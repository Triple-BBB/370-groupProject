A speck -- a nightbird, or a bat -- framed in the moon’s surface, approaches rapidly, then -- WHOOSH! -- passes beneath. Far below, a sea of treetops shift eerily. 9 EXT. MALFOY MANOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 9 We PLUMMET THROUGH the shifting trees TO a narrow moonlit lane. A SHADOW ripples across the ground like a kite made of water. A BOOT touches down upon the graveled lane, then another. A cape flutters slowly down upon the shoulders of a wizard, lank hair splayed across his wind- blown collar. His head turns. Moonlight strikes his pale face. SNAPE. Moving. Up a wide drive, to a pair of wrought iron gates. Beyond, a large manor that has seen better days. A RUSTLING sounds. Snape wheels, draws his wand.

As he enters, dark eyes in torch-lit portraits track him from above. 11 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 11 A door looms at the end of a hallway. Reaching it, Snape hesitates for a heartbeat, then enters. 12 INT. DRAWING ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 12 Two dozen figures sit silently at a large ornate table, illuminated by the flickering light of a fireplace. Snape studies the scene, then his eyes rise. Revolving slowly near the ceiling, as if suspended by an invisible rope, is an unconscious WOMAN (CHARITY BURBAGE).",RON
