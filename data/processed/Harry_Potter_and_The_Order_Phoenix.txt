As the WARNER BROS. LOGO appears an eerie LIGHT grows in
the darkness beyond. PUSH THROUGH and TILT UP to find a
glowing ORB, radiating power. It grows BLINDING as it
fills the screen--

TILT DOWN to a blistering summer sky. A TITLE CARD appears:
HARRY POTTER
and
The Order of the Phoenix
A carpet of toy-like houses and parched yellow lawns
appears below us. Faint SOUNDS rise up: a tinny RADIO
("Take it from me, Martin, not a drop of rain to be had
out there..."), KIDS PLAYING, SPRINKLERS CHUGGING...
A FLUTTER OF BLACK CLOTH dances at the edge of frame as
we MOVE toward a DESERTED PLAYGROUND, where a lone figure
sits on the swings...
7 EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATE AFTERNOON 7
HARRY POTTER searches hungrily through a newspaper...
grimaces in frustration...
MALCOLM
...squealed like a pig, didn't he?
PIERS (O.S.)
Brilliant punch, Big D; d'you see
his face?
Harry peers over the paper at the approaching DUDLEY
DURSLEY, his physique newly-transformed into that of a
burly boxer. He is surrounded by his equally big and
stupid GANG. Harry hesitates...then impulsively lowers
the paper.
HARRY
Hey "Big D." Beat up another ten
year old?
Dudley falters as he sees Harry--glances anxiously at
his mates--then quickly puffs up his chest.
DUDLEY
This one deserved it.
2.
HARRY
Four against one. Very brave.
DUDLEY
Yeah, well you're one to talk.
Moaning in your sleep every night.
At least I'm not afraid of my
pillow.
HARRY
What are you talking about?
DUDLEY
"Don't kill Cedric! Don't kill
Cedric!" Who's Cedric--your
boyfriend?
Harry pales. The GANG HOOTS, fueling Dudley's bravado.
DUDLEY
"Dad! Help me, Dad!"
HARRY
Shut up.
THUNDER CRACKS. The other boys peer uneasily at the sky.
DUDLEY
He's going to kill me, Mum!
HARRY
Shut up Dudley, I'm warning you--!
In his anger Harry pulls out his WAND. Dudley freezes at
the sight--the GANG exchanges confused looks--
A STIFF WIND suddenly kicks up, blowing Harry's hair from
his scar. Dudley looks up at the sky--where UNEARTHLY
DARK CLOUDS are coalescing.
DUDLEY
Wh-what are you doing?
HARRY
I'm not doing anything.
The WIND grows stronger, bangs the swings crazily as
Dudley's GANG exchanges worried looks--and bolts. Dudley
stares helplessly after them--
LIGHTNING splits the sky. A SIZZLING drop of RAIN hits
the pavement. Another. Harry and Dudley look at each
other--and run for it.
8 EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - DUSK 8
CRANE UP TO REVEAL the edge of the subdivision giving
way to a RAISED DUAL CARRIAGEWAY, heavy with speeding
3.
TRAFFIC. Harry and Dudley race towards the UNDERPASS that
yawns beneath it as the skies open in a TORRENTIAL
DOWNPOUR.
9 EXT. UNDERPASS - DUSK 9
TRAFFIC DOPPLERS overhead as the boys take cover from
the storm, breathing hard. They peer uneasily into the
gloom of the darkened underpass, enter...
10 EXT. SKY - RAINDROP'S POV 10
From HIGH ABOVE we FALL with a RAINDROP, ROTATING AROUND
it as we drop sickeningly towards the CARRIAGEWAY below.
A TATTERED BLACK CLOAK SWOOPS through frame just before
we SMASH into the PAVEMENT--
10A EXT. UNDERPASS - CONTINUOUS 10A
The sickly yellow FLUORESCENTS suddenly flicker, DIE.
Harry and Dudley freeze, profiles etched by purple
thunderstorm light...and then Harry notices: their breath
is visible. CRACKLING ICE forms over the puddle Dudley's
standing in--as Harry pales, realizing--
HARRY
Oh no.
The black skeletal figure of a DEMENTOR silently unfurls
from the darkness above Harry--its bony fingers clutch
Harry's neck and pull him out of frame with a strangled
GASP, as his wand goes skittering away into darkness.
Terrified, Dudley runs for it--right toward ANOTHER
DEMENTOR floating eerily at the other end of the tunnel.
HARRY looks around desperately for his wand as the
Dementor begins to FEED on his lifeforce. He is fading
fast. Finally he GASPS--
HARRY
Lumos!
A LIGHT FLARES in the shadows as his WAND TIP IGNITES.
HARRY
Accio!
The wand FLIES into his hand--
HARRY
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
A LUMINOUS SILVER STAG erupts from the tip of Harry's
wand. Its antlers pierce the heart of the Dementor,
4.
hurling it out the mouth of the underpass, where it is
sucked up into the storm.
A strangled SCREAM spins Harry to see the second Dementor
hovering over Dudley's face, a SILVERY WHITE LIGHT
drifting from the boy's mouth...
And then the Dementor looks up in alarm as a GHOSTLY
GALLOP approaches--and the STAG's SILVER ANTLERS PIERCE
it, hurl it too up into the night.
A deafening SILENCE...then pattering RAIN and normal
TRAFFIC returns. Drenched and shivering, Harry watches
as the STAG canters to the end of the tunnel, DISSOLVES
into silver mist.
The FLUORESCENTS BUZZ, FLICKER back on.
Dudley GROANS, his eyes rolling miserably. Harry kneels
beside him...
Then a rhythmic SQUEAKING spins Harry, wand raised--to
see a silhouetted FIGURE stop in the entrance, dragging
a shopping trolley. A pair of TARTAN CARPET SLIPPERS step
into the light...
HARRY
Mrs. Figg?
ARABELLA FIGG wipes the gray flyaway hair from her eyes.
Harry realizes his wand is out, quickly tries to hide it.
MRS. FIGG
Don't put away your wand, boy!
(off Harry's confusion)
They might come back!
11 EXT. PRIVET DRIVE - NIGHT 11
Dudley MOANS miserably, tongue lolling. A last RUMBLE of
THUNDER draws a nervous glance at the passing storm from
Mrs. Figg, as Harry struggles with Dudley's dead weight.
MRS. FIGG
Dementors, in Little Whinging!
What's next, Giants trodding the
M4? The whole world's gone topsy-
turvy...!
HARRY
I don't understand. How do you
know about--?
MRS. FIGG
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye
on you.
5.
HARRY
Dumbledore asked--you know
Dumbledore--?
MRS. FIGG
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year did you
expect him to let you wander
around on your own? Good Lord, boy,
they told me you were intelligent.
They have arrived at Number Four Privet Drive.
MRS. FIGG
Now: get inside and stay there. I
expect someone will be in touch
soon, but whatever happens: don't
leave the house!
Harry opens his mouth to protest but Mrs. Figg, not
unkindly, silences him with a POINTING FINGER.
12 INT. LIVING ROOM - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - NIGHT 12
PETUNIA DURSLEY tears her eyes from the TV with a
distracted smile.
AUNT PETUNIA
Diddykins? Is that...
She blanches as she sees Harry lugging Dudley inside.
Dudley looks greenly up at his mother, opens his mouth
to speak--and promptly vomits into a potted plant.
AUNT PETUNIA
DIDDY! VERNON, come quick!
VERNON DURSLEY, standing in front of the open freezer
eating from a carton of ice cream, looks up vaguely.
As he enters Dudley HEAVES into the plant again; Vernon
grimaces in distaste.
AUNT PETUNIA
We have to take him to Hospital!
UNCLE VERNON
Who did this to you, boy?
Dudley's shaking finger rises at Harry. Vernon approaches,
brandishing the dripping spoon.
UNCLE VERNON
Happy are we now?! You've finally
done it! You've driven him loony!
AUNT PETUNIA
Don't say that, Vernon!
6.
UNCLE VERNON
Look at him, Petunia!
(Dudley stares droolingly
up at her)
He's off his chump! Puggles!
Crackers! Our boy's gone yampy!
(jabbing at Harry with
his spoon)
Well I've reached my limit, d'you
hear? I've taken the last of your
nonsense--!
A sudden SCREECH makes everyone turn as an OWL DIVEBOMBS
down the chimney, CAROMS off the hearth, LAUNCHES back
into the air, drops a PARCHMENT ENVELOPE at Harry's
feet--then ZOOMS erratically out the kitchen window.
Vernon appeals helplessly to the heavens, emits a tiny,
defeated SQUEAK.
But Harry is staring down at the envelope--a PURPLE SEAL
reads MINISTRY OF MAGIC. As he picks it up and opens it,
a LETTER elaborately UNFOLDS ITSELF, as the WAX of the
seal DEFORMS into a pair of thin, humorless LIPS:
MAFALDA HOPKIRK
Dear Mr. Potter: The Ministry has
received intelligence that at
twenty-three minutes past six this
evening you performed the Patronus
Charm in the presence of a Muggle.
As a clear violation of the Decree
for the Reasonable Restriction of
Underage Sorcery, you are hereby
expelled from Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hoping
that you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
With that the letter DISINTEGRATES into a cloud of
PARTICLES, which spirals itself and VANISHES with a POP.
Silence...and then Uncle Vernon's eyes narrow in
vindictive triumph, as he turns on the stunned Harry:
UNCLE VERNON
Justice.
In the b.g., Dudley again heaves into the plant.
13 OMITTED 13
14 INT. HARRY'S ROOM - NIGHT 14
As we watch the car SQUEAL away PULL BACK to reveal Harry
at the window. He POUNDS the wall in a burst of anger...
HEDWIG turns her snowy head in alarm as the VIBRATION--
subtly, magically AMPLIFIED--sends a SHUDDER through the
room--causing something to SHATTER behind Harry.
7.
HARRY
Sorry, Hedwig...
Harry turns...bends down to find the moving PHOTO of
JAMES and LILY POTTER, its glass broken. As he picks up
the broken photo, for a moment Harry's frustration
darkens to despair...
LATER. Harry has fallen asleep on his bed. He twitches
uneasily as we hear frightening WHISPERS grow...
VOLDEMORT (V.O.)
Kill the spare.
14A-1 EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT - HARRY'S DREAM 14A-1
IN SILENCE: CEDRIC DIGGORY slowly turns in confusion--
locks eyes with Harry, terror dawning in his eyes. He
silently cries out--
HARRY
Cedric--!
A BLINDING FLASH OF POISONOUS GREEN--A ROAR OF SOUND--
Harry stares as a familiar, ghostly visage resolves
through a haze of steam, underlit by a glowing cauldron:
VOLDEMORT. His bone-white head bowed. As his gaze slowly
rises his EYES OPEN, snake-slits IRISING--
14A-2 INT. HARRY'S ROOM - NIGHT - SCENE CONTINUES 14A-2
Harry's eyes fly open. The SOUND of a sudden WIND; a
muffled CLATTER comes from downstairs.
Harry silently reaches for his wand...an ominous HUMMING
SOUND is coming up the stairs. As Harry cautiously
approaches the door PINK LIGHT stabs through the keyhole--
The lock CLICKS. Harry jumps back just in time as the
door BLOWS OPEN, knocking him off his feet. He scrambles
for his wand, turns on his elbows--
A striking TABLEAU of WINDBLOWN, backlit figures stand
in the doorway...and then an O.S. CRASH breaks the spell.
TONKS (O.S.)
Watch that, dangerous bit of
carpet there...
The WIND dies as the SILHOUETTES sag wearily.
MADEYE MOODY
Tonks--for God's sake...
A SILHOUETTE with a punk haircut trips into frame--
8.
TONKS
Very clean, these Muggles. Bit
unnatural...
--and completes the tableau. As she peers into the room
the tip of her wand IGNITES, revealing a young WITCH with
twinkling eyes and SHOCKING PINK HAIR.
TONKS
Oh, this is better...
Harry peers at another silhouette swigging from a flask...
HARRY
Professor Moody? What are you
doing here?
Moody steps into the light as he wipes his mouth.
MADEYE MOODY
Rescuing you, of course.
14A INT. STAIRWELL - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - NIGHT 14A
Tonks, Moody, KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT, ELPHIAS DOGE, and
EMMELINE VANCE push Harry before them as they trundle
down the stairs, carrying Harry's things.
HARRY
But where are we going? If I've
been expelled from Hogwarts--
MADEYE MOODY
You haven't been--not yet, anyway.
Kingsley, you take point.
HARRY
But--the letter said--
SHACKLEBOLT
(passing Harry)
Dumbledore's persuaded the Minister
to suspend your expulsion--
Before Harry can respond Moody shoves him through the
front door--
15 EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 15
--and out onto the lawn.
SHACKLEBOLT
--pending a formal hearing.
HARRY
A hearing--?
9.
TONKS
Don't worry, Harry. We'll explain
everything when we get back to
Headquarters--
MADEYE MOODY
Shhh! Not here, Nymphadora.
Tonks goes rigid--her HAIR MAGICALLY turning an angry
RED, as she fixes Shacklebolt with a deadly look.
TONKS
Don't. Call me. Nymphadora.
MADEYE MOODY
(mounting his broom)
Stay in formation everyone. Don't
break ranks if one of us is killed.
TONKS
Stop being so cheerful, Madeye--
he'll think we're not taking this
seriously...
She WINKS at Harry, nonplussed--
16 EXT. SKY/PRIVET DRIVE - NIGHT 16
The toy houses fall away beneath us. Harry is euphoric
as the group soars through a star-strewn sky. Moody nods
to Shacklebolt and they switch into OVERDRIVE, bank
toward the glittering sprawl of London.
17 OMITTED 17
17A EXT. SKY OVER LONDON - NIGHT [DUSK FOR NIGHT] 17A
The formation drops low to the river. Hurtling inches
above the surface they whiz beneath the city's bridges,
swerving around barges and speeding past TOURIST BOATS.
ON THE SOUTH BANK a group of SKATEBOARDERS practice
stunts; on the river beyond we see only the parallel
WAKES of the Guards' broomsticks.
18 EXT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT 18
A GARBAGE TRUCK is making late rounds; as it passes it
REVEALS Harry and the others crossing a shabby square.
The MUFFLED POUNDING of a STEREO draws Harry's attention
to nearby windows, open to the summer night. A GOLDFISH
BOWL sits in one; beyond a middle-aged COUPLE watches TV.
In another window a BOHO MAN is cooking dinner...
10.
MADEYE MOODY
Get a move on, sonny!
Madeye brusquely pushes Harry toward the sidewalk,
raising his glowing WAND ahead of them--
--where a battered DOOR emerges between two houses...
quickly followed by straining dirty WALLS and grimy
WINDOWS, as a new building magically begins to push the
houses on either side out of its way--
QUICK CUTS
The water in the Goldfish Bowl VIBRATES slightly as the
FISH SWISHES; but the couple doesn't look up from the TV--
Chimes gently TINKLE in the second window as the Boho
Man's GIRLFRIEND joins him in the kitchen, and he holds
up a spoon for her to taste...
BACK TO SCENE
--the facade finishes expanding into place with a gentle
POP...as the STEREO THUDS on, unperturbed.
19 INT. FOYER - GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT - HARRY'S POV 19
The DOOR opens to reveal old-fashioned GAS LAMPS and
peeling wallpaper; a cobwebby chandelier. The air is
thick with the mildewed perfume of aristocratic decay.
As the others bring in his things behind him, Harry's
attention is drawn to a DOOR at the end of the long hall;
we hear VOICES beyond. Harry starts toward it...
As Moody hurries past we glimpse a candle-lit DRAWING
ROOM packed with WIZARDS arguing in urgent tones; among
them REMUS LUPIN, MINERVA MCGONAGALL and ARTHUR WEASLEY.
As Harry peers closer another face leans into the light:
SIRIUS BLACK. He glances up from a moment of intense
debate...sees Harry. For an instant his ferocity melts
into warmth--
--and then Tonks pushes past Harry to enter the drawing
room, blocking Sirius from view. Tonks flashes Harry a
sympathetic smile--and promptly trips over a troll-foot
umbrella stand. Shacklebolt shakes his head, sighs...
MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.)
Harry!
A tense, careworn MRS. WEASLEY emerges from the drawing
room, quickly shuts the door behind her.
HARRY
Mrs. Weasley...?
11.
MRS. WEASLEY
Thank heavens you're all right...
She hugs Harry tight, her drawn face deeply relieved.
But as she pushes Harry to arm's-length to inspect him
she forces a maternal smile.
MRS. WEASLEY
A bit peaky--but I'm afraid dinner
will have to wait till the
meeting's finished.
HARRY
(eyeing the door)
Yeah, about that...
MRS. WEASLEY
No time to explain. Upstairs,
first door on the left!
20 EXT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT 20
Harry takes in the PLAQUES of SHRUNKEN ELF HEADS as he
climbs the stairs. As he reaches the landing he spots an
elderly HOUSE ELF (KREACHER) rummaging furtively through
a cabinet down the hall. He MUTTERS to himself:
KREACHER
...mudbloods and werewolves and
traitors and thieves...if my poor
Mistress knew the scum they've let
into her house what would she say
to old Kreacher...oh the shame...
As Harry's foot CREAKS on the landing Kreacher turns in
alarm--for a moment his eyes narrow viciously--then he
quickly shuts the drawer, bitterly forces a nod, scuttles
off. Harry frowns...then hears indistinct VOICES behind
one of the doors. He cautiously approaches...opens
it...as Hermione's hug nearly knocks him flat.
HERMIONE
HARRY--!
21 INT. BEDROOM - GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 21
RON WEASLEY and HERMIONE GRANGER greet their old friend.
HERMIONE
Are you all right? We overheard
them talking about the Dementor
attack; you must tell us
everything--
RON
(grinning)
Let the man breathe, Hermione.
12.
HERMIONE
--and this hearing at the
Ministry--it's just outrageous!
I've looked it up and they simply
can't expel you! It's completely
unfair!
HARRY
Yeah, there's a lot of that going
around. What is this place anyway?
Hermione and Ron exchange a look as Harry looks around.
RON
It's Headquarters...
HERMIONE
...of the Order of the Phoenix.
It's a secret society; Dumbledore
founded it back when they first
fought You-Know-Who.
HARRY
Couldn't have put any of this in a
letter I suppose. I've gone all
summer without any bloody news!
Hermione and Ron share a guilty look--
RON
We wanted to write mate, really we
did--only--
HARRY
Only what?
HERMIONE
Only Dumbledore made us swear not
to tell you anything.
HARRY
(stunned)
Dumbledore said that?
(they nod)
But...why would he want to keep me
in the dark? Maybe I could help!
After all, I'm the one who saw
Voldemort return; I'm the one who
fought him. I'm the one who saw
Cedric...
Harry falters, suddenly emotional. Ron and Hermione
exchange a concerned look--then POP--a grinning FRED and
GEORGE WEASLEY APPARATE on either side of Harry.
FRED
Harry.
13.
GEORGE
Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
FRED
Don't bottle up your anger, Harry;
let it out!
GEORGE
Anyway if you're all done
shouting--
FRED
--want to hear something really
interesting...?
21A EXT. CORRIDOR - GRIMMAULD PLACE - MOMENTS LATER 21A
The meeting has just ended. WIZARDS and WITCHES murmur
in troubled tones as they exit the Parlor. Just above
the door FIND a floating DISEMBODIED EAR...it CUPS IN,
listening to the shadowy figures still inside...
SIRIUS (O.S.)
...if it wasn't for Harry we
wouldn't even know Voldemort was
back! He isn't a child, Molly!
MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.)
...Well he's not an adult either!
He's not James, Sirius.
We rapidly ASCEND the Ear's flesh-colored cord to the
landing above--where the twins and the trio are gathered
tightly around the other EAR. GINNY WEASLEY silently
joins them, mouths "hi" to Harry.
SIRIUS (O.S.)
Well he isn't your son!
MRS. WEASLEY (O.S.)
He's as good as! Who else has he
got?
SIRIUS (O.S.)
He's got me!
Harry flushes with gratitude; Hermione smiles.
SNAPE (O.S.)
How touchingly paternal, Black.
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be
a felon, just like his Godfather.
SIRIUS (O.S.)
You stay out of this, Snivellus--
HARRY
Snape's part of the Order?
14.
RON
(nods, grim)
Git.
22 OMITTED 22
23 INT. FOYER - GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT 23
The front door elaborately locks and bolts itself as Mrs.
Weasley meets the trio, Ginny at the bottom of the stairs.
MRS. WEASLEY
Well! We'll be eating down in the
kitchen--
Without warning Fred and George APPARATE--CRACK!--on
either side of her. Mrs. Weasley SCREAMS, calls after them.
MRS. WEASLEY
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE
MAGIC NOW DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO
WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERYTHING!
(instantly maternal)
Are you hungry, Harry?
Before Harry can respond MR. WEASLEY claps a warm hand
on Harry's shoulder.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
You're sure you're all right,
Harry? Gave us all quite a turn.
Harry opens his mouth to reply but before he can--
SIRIUS (O.S.)
What, no hello for me?
Harry turns to see a grinning Sirius, his long dark hair
swept back from his glittering eyes.
HARRY
Sirius.
And for the first time since we've seen him...Harry
smiles. As he and Sirius EMBRACE, tight--
24 INT. BASEMENT KITCHEN - GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT 24
A cauldron of STEW stirs itself; a KNIFE chops vegetables.
Tonks entertains Ginny by transforming her nose into a
beak, a Pig's snout. In the shadows Kreacher cleans up
empties. Harry sits near Mr. Weasley, who frowns deeply
at a PARCHMENT with a familiar PURPLE SEAL...
15.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
...this is most unusual...it seems
Minister Fudge has called your
hearing before the entire
Wizengamot...
He grimly hands the parchment to Lupin to examine it...
SIRIUS
It's a set-up. A chance to publicly
discredit Harry.
LUPIN
I'm afraid you may be right,
Padfoot...
HARRY
I don't understand. What does the
Ministry of Magic have against me?
Silence. Tonks and Ginny frown; Ron and Hermione exchange
an apprehensive look. Sirius hesitates...
MADEYE MOODY
(quietly)
Show him. He'll find out soon
enough.
Tonks reluctantly produces a copy of the Daily Prophet,
hands it to Harry. A front-page editorial features
Harry's photo; the headline reading: "Boy Who Lived"
magically changes to "Boy Who Lies?" Harry is stunned.
Sirius frowns...he knows exactly how Harry feels.
SIRIUS
Fudge has been attacking Dumbledore
as well. Fudge is using all his
power--including his influence at
the Daily Prophet--to smear anyone
who claims the Dark Lord has
returned.
HARRY
But...why?
LUPIN
The Minister thinks Dumbledore is
after his job. That he's lying
about Voldemort's return as a ploy
to gain political power.
HARRY
But that's insane! No one in their
right mind would believe--
16.
LUPIN
Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in
his right mind. It has been twisted
and warped--by fear.
(he stares into the fire)
Fear makes people do terrible
things, Harry. The last time
Voldemort gained power he almost
destroyed everything we hold most
dear. Now that he's returned...I'm
afraid the Minister will do almost
anything to avoid facing that
terrifying truth.
HARRY
So what's Voldemort been up to--
seeing as everyone's so
thoughtfully ignoring him?
Lupin hesitates--glances up at Mrs. Weasley, who is
looking at him pleadingly. He frowns...then reluctantly
nods at Sirius, who turns to Harry:
SIRIUS
We think he wants to build up his
army again. Fourteen years ago he
had huge numbers at his command--
not just witches and wizards but
all manner of Dark creatures. He's
been recruiting heavily, and we've
been attempting to do the same...
(hesitates)
But gathering followers isn't the
only thing he's interested in.
Moody's EYE SWIVELS instantly to Sirius--he CLEARS HIS
THROAT loudly but Sirius ignores him, continues:
SIRIUS
We think Voldemort may be after
something--something he didn't
have last time...
MADEYE MOODY
(warns, low)
Sirius--
HARRY
You mean...like a weapon?
MRS. WEASLEY
THAT'S ENOUGH!
(all eyes turn to Mrs.
Weasley, wrought)
He's only a boy! Say much more and
you might as well induct him into
the Order straightaway!
17.
HARRY
Good--I want to join. If
Voldemort's building an army I
want to fight.
Sirius nods, proud. Lupin sighs deeply.
LUPIN
I know, Harry. But for all you've
been through, you're not an adult--
not yet.
(hesitates)
Still...if things continue the way
they're going...I'm afraid before
long you may get your chance.
Mrs. Weasley pulls Ginny to her; Hermione draws closer
to Ron. Even the twins looks somber. Harry stares into
the CRACKLING FIRE--
25 INT. BEDROOM - GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT 25
Harry twists restlessly in his sleep. We hear frightening
WHISPERS. As we PUSH IN on Harry a RUSHING WIND GROWS--a
horrific SQUEAL--
26 OMITTED 26

28 EXT. UNDERGROUND STATION ENTRANCE - LONDON - DAY 28
--which becomes the BRAKES of an UNDERGROUND TRAIN. FIND
Harry and Mr. Weasley exiting with a tide of COMMUTERS.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Trains under the ground! So
ingenious, these Muggles...
(studying his map)
This way, Harry--mustn't be late...
29 EXT. SIDE ROAD - LONDON - DAY 29
A deserted area of Government offices. Mr. Weasley
approaches a red TELEPHONE BOX.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Well! Here we are.
He gestures "after you" to the bewildered Harry, then
folds himself beside him into the telephone box.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
I've never used the visitor's
entrance before. This should be fun!
18.
As he reaches for the receiver he inadvertently smushes
Harry's face into the glass.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Sorry...let's see... M...A...G...
I...C.
For a moment nothing happens--and then the telephone box
SHUDDERS, and with a dull GRINDING begins sinking into
the ground.
Harry watches in amazement as the pavement rises over
the windows, and darkness closes over them. And then a
chink of GOLDEN LIGHT illuminates Harry's feet, rises up
his body toward his astonished eyes--
30 INT. ATRIUM - MINISTRY OF MAGIC - DAY 30
The Ministry's splendid Lobby comes into view: walls
lined with GILDED FIREPLACES, queues of WIZARDS arriving
and departing in flashes of green light. At the end of
the hall is an enormous GOLDEN FOUNTAIN depicting a group
of MAGICAL CREATURES looking up at a noble WIZARD.
A GIANT FIGURE of CORNELIUS FUDGE stares balefully down
at Harry and Mr. Weasley as they thread their way through
the sea of briefcase and newspaper-carrying MINISTRY
WORKERS; several stop and stare as they recognize Harry.
31 INT. LIFT LOBBY - DAY 31
Harry and Mr. Weasley join a crowd squeezing into one of
the golden-gated LIFTS. As they enter Harry peers in
confusion at the HANGING STRAPS above them...then finds
himself face to face with another Daily Prophet editorial:
DUMBLEDORE: Daft or Dangerous? The WIZARD reading the
paper peers suspiciously down at Harry, as a big-bearded
WIZARD holding a large cardboard box squeezes in beside
Mr. Weasley. Something in the box CACKLES, emits a small
jet of FLAME, singeing the wizard's beard.
BOB
'Morning Arthur.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
'Morning Bob.
BOB absently brushes the ash from his beard as a FLOCK
of pale violet PAPER AIRPLANES swoop into the lift, flap
idly above Harry's head. Mr. Weasley confides:
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Interdepartmental memos. We used
to use owls, but the mess was
unbelievable.
19.
Just before the gates close Shacklebolt hurries in. As
the lift LURCHES and RECEDES horizontally, he whispers
urgently into Mr. Weasley's ear; he pales.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Merlin's Beard. Thank you Kingsley.
(to Harry)
They've changed the time of your
hearing.
HARRY
When is it?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Five minutes ago.
As Wizards automatically reach for hanging straps above
them the lift suddenly plunges from view--
31A OMITTED 31A

34 INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - STONE CORRIDOR - DAY 34
The DOORS OPEN to reveal Harry and Mr. Weasley, now alone.
LIFT VOICE
Department of Mysteries.
Mr. Weasley pulls Harry out of the lift--and turns down
a torch-lit corridor.
HARRY'S POV: rounding a corner we glimpse CORNELIUS FUDGE
conferring intently with LUCIUS MALFOY. They look up in
surprise as Harry passes. Harry stares back--not noticing
the PLAIN BLACK DOOR at the end of a long hallway beyond...
ARTHUR WEASLEY
...now remember, during the hearing
you must speak only when spoken
too, and stay calm--you've done
nothing wrong. As the Muggles say,
the truth will out, yes...?
They arrive at a large iron door. Harry starts in...but
pauses as he sees Mr. Weasley isn't coming with him.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Not allowed in, I'm afraid. Good
luck, Harry.
Harry frowns...takes a deep breath...and enters the
lion's den. We FOLLOW HIM in...
20.
35 INT. TRIAL CHAMBER - DAY 35
As Harry enters a court of FIFTY WIZARDS peer down at
him with varying degrees of hostility and curiosity. As
he approaches the chair at center, Fudge takes his place
in the front. The chamber's four giant FLAMES gutter,
and the crowd settles.
FUDGE
Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth
of August into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter, resident at
number four, Privet Drive, Little
Whinging, Surrey.
On Fudge's left sits AMELIA BONES, peering curiously at
Harry through her monocle. On his right sits a broad-
faced WITCH dressed in pink. PERCY WEASLEY is in the row
behind, taking notes.
FUDGE
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald
Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia
Susan Bones, Department of Magical
Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane
Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to
the Minister--
DUMBLEDORE (O.S.)
--Witness for the defense--
All heads turn as ALBUS DUMBLEDORE strides serenely
across the courtroom.
DUMBLEDORE
--Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore.
Harry lights up in relief. But Dumbledore avoids his gaze.
FUDGE
Er. You got our message that the
time and place of the hearing had
been changed, did you?
DUMBLEDORE
I must have missed it. But due to
a lucky mistake I arrived at the
Ministry three hours early.
(helpfully)
The charges?
FUDGE
(a baleful beat, then:)
The charges against the accused
are as follows: That he did
knowingly and in full awareness of
the illegality of his actions
(MORE)
21.
FUDGE (CONT'D)
produce a Patronus Charm in the
presence of a Muggle.
(fiercely to Harry)
Do you deny producing said Patronus?
HARRY
No, but--
FUDGE
Do you deny it was in the presence
of a Muggle, one Dursley Dudley?
(Percy leans down,
whispers to him)
Dudley Dursley?
HARRY
No, but--
FUDGE
--and you were aware you are
forbidden to use magic outside
school while under the age of
seventeen?
HARRY
Yes, but--
FUDGE
(broadly)
Witches and Wizards of the
Wizengamot--
HARRY
I only did it because of the
Dementors!
A HUSH falls over the room. AMELIA BONES peers at Harry
over her monocle.
AMELIA BONES
Dementors? In Little Whinging?
FUDGE
Clever. Muggles can't see Dementors.
Highly convenient.
HARRY
I'm not lying! There were two of
them, and if I hadn't--
FUDGE
Enough! I'm sorry to interrupt
what I'm sure would have been a
very well-rehearsed story, but as
you can produce no witnesses--
22.
DUMBLEDORE
Pardon me, Minister, but as it
happens...we can.
ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
Mrs. Figg--in her Sunday best but still wearing carpet
slippers--looks nervously up at the court.
AMELIA BONES
Please describe the attack. What
did they look like?
MRS. FIGG
Well...one was very large, and the
other rather skinny--
FUDGE
Not the boys, the Dementors.
MRS. FIGG
Oh. Right... Big...cloaked...
(shivers)
...then everything went cold...as
though all the happiness had gone
from the world...
Her voice trembles and dies. Amelia Bones raises an
eyebrow at Fudge.
FUDGE
Now look here! Dementors don't
just wander into a Muggle suburb
and happen across a wizard. The
odds are astronomical--!
DUMBLEDORE
Oh, I don't think any of us believe
the Dementors were there by
coincidence, Minister.
The crowd MURMURS.
UMBRIDGE (O.S.)
Hem hem...
FUDGE
The chair recognizes Senior
Undersecretary Dolores Umbridge.
The pink-dressed WITCH leans forward. She wears a black
velvet bow and speaks in a fluttery, girlish voice: meet
DOLORES UMBRIDGE.
UMBRIDGE
I'm sure I must have misunderstood
you, Professor. Dementors are,
after all, under the control of
(MORE)
23.
UMBRIDGE (CONT'D)
the Ministry of Magic. So silly of
me, but it sounded for a moment as
though you were suggesting that
the Ministry had ordered the
attack on this boy!
She laughs a chilling, silvery laugh.
DUMBLEDORE
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madame Undersecretary...which is
why I'm confident the Ministry
will be making a full inquiry into
why two Dementors were so very far
from Azkaban, and why they attacked
without authorization.
(turning to Fudge)
Of course...there is another who
might have been behind the attack.
Fudge goes rigid. Dumbledore steps forward in a private
appeal.
DUMBLEDORE
Cornelius...I implore you to
listen to reason. The evidence
that the Dark Lord has returned is
incontravert--
FUDGE
HE'S. NOT. BACK!
Silence! Fudge is quivering with rage; even Percy is
taken aback. Dumbledore sighs deeply...then quietly
addresses the Panel.
DUMBLEDORE
In the matter of Harry Potter: the
law plainly states that magic may
be used before Muggles in life-
threatening situations.
FUDGE
Laws can be changed, Dumbledore.
DUMBLEDORE
Clearly--if it has become practice
to hold a full criminal trial to
deal with a simple matter of
underage magic.
Some of the wizards shift uncomfortably in their seats.
AMELIA BONES
Those in favor of clearing the
witness of all charges?
24.
Harry holds his breath. Hands slowly rise, a few at first,
then more, until most of the court is included.
AMELIA BONES
Those in favor of conviction?
Fudge and a half dozen others raise their hands,
including Percy and Umbridge. Fudge's eyes narrow in
impotent fury.
FUDGE
Cleared of all charges.
As the assembled adjourn Harry turns gratefully to
Dumbledore--but the Headmaster is already sweeping away,
leaving Harry staring uncomprehendingly after him.
With a shiver of apprehension, Harry turns to find one
motionless face in the risers, silently appraising him...
Dolores Umbridge smiles a honeyed smile.
35A EXT. PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS - DAY 35A
Moody takes paranoid point as Shacklebolt and Tonks flank
Harry; Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Fred, George and Mr. and
Mrs. Weasley are just ahead. CRANE UP as the group
navigates the clattering chaos of PARENTS and STUDENTS...
Harry frowns as he hears the SOUND of TROTTING
PAWS...looks down...where a large, rather mangy BLACK
DOG walks in lockstep beside him. Suddenly Moody is there;
furiously grabs the Dog by the scruff of the neck--
MADEYE MOODY
Are you barking mad? You'll blow
the entire operation--!
The Dog GROWLS, pulls free of Moody's grip and slinks
guiltily to an empty area of the platform. As Harry
hurries after him into a WAITING ROOM we see through its
OPAQUE GLASS the DOG TRANSFORM; his black fur becomes a
shabby black overcoat cloaked around--
HARRY
Sirius! What are you doing here?!
If somebody sees you--
SIRIUS
(grinning)
Had to see you off, didn't I?
Anyway what's life without a
little risk?
HARRY
I just don't want to see you
chucked back in Azkaban!
25.
SIRIUS
Being trapped in that house day
and night is almost as bad. Worst
part about being a fugitive is how
bloody boring it is...
(softening)
I take it back. The worst part is
people believing everything they
read in the papers...
(Harry smiles gratefully)
Anyway. I wanted you to have this.
Sirius produces a tattered WIZARDING PHOTOGRAPH. In it a
small CROWD OF WIZARDS wave and lift their glasses.
Dumbledore is at center.
SIRIUS
Original Order of the Phoenix.
HARRY
You all look so young.
SIRIUS
We were.
(pointing)
Marlene McKinnon; she was killed
two weeks after this was taken;
Voldemort wiped out her entire
family... Frank and Alice
Longbottom...
HARRY
Neville's parents...
SIRIUS
A fate worse than death, you ask
me...
FRANK and ALICE LONGBOTTOM smile happily out at us. Harry
frowns...and then his breath catches as he spots JAMES
and LILY POTTER. James has his arm around Sirius, who
wears short hair and an innocent grin.
SIRIUS
It's been fourteen years...and
still a day doesn't go by I don't
miss your dad.
HARRY
I wish I could have known him...
Harry gazes at his father...then looks through the
doorway at the sea of happy STUDENTS boarding the train,
kissing PARENTS...all blissfully unaware.
HARRY
Sirius...Do you really think
there's going to be a war?
26.
Sirius looks at his Godson, torn between his impulse to
console and his desire to be honest...
SIRIUS
It feels like it did before. Like
the calm before a storm.
Harry shivers. Hands the photo back to Sirius--
SIRIUS
You keep it. Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now...
Harry takes this in, chilled. He looks down at the photo.
Innocent smiles from happier days. SOUND UPCUT: A TRAIN
WHISTLE SHRIEKS--
ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
STEAM BILLOWS from the Hogwarts Express. It begins to move.
As Harry hurries to step onboard something catches his
eye down the deserted platform... Time seems to slow;
the air shimmers with dreamlike hyperclarity...
VOLDEMORT stands at the end of the platform. Looking
straight at Harry. His head slowly tilts--
35B INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - MOVING - DUSK 35B
Harry's head leans against the window, asleep. As his
eyes fly open his head tilts erect, mirroring Voldemort's
move. Harry shivers, looks out the rain-spattered window--
35C EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - MOVING - SAME TIME - DUSK 35C
Harry's troubled face dwindles from view as we PULL UP
and AWAY...to reveal a global view of the wild countryside,
the glinting towers of HOGWARTS CASTLE tiny on the
horizon. We sense the curvature of the earth as the last
rays of daylight slip away...
36 OMITTED 36
THRU THRU

41 EXT. ROAD - HOGSMEADE STATION - NIGHT 41
A sign reads HOGSMEADE STATION. As the trio start down
the path toward the Carriage Road Harry frowns:
everywhere he looks his eyes are met with nervous glances,
furtive WHISPERS...and copies of the Daily Prophet. DRACO
MALFOY--flanked, as ever, by CRABBE and GOYLE, calls out:
27.
DRACO MALFOY
I'm surprised the Ministry's still
letting you walk around free,
Potter. Better enjoy it while you
can--I expect there's a cell in
Azkaban with your name on it...
He laughs...then, without warning Harry suddenly moves
toward Draco. Draco flinches; a surprised Ron holds Harry
back...
RON
It's only Malfoy, Harry. What'd
you expect...?
HARRY
Just--stay away from me...
DRACO MALFOY
What'd I tell you--complete nutter.
MOMENTS LATER. As the trio approach the rain-washed road
we see a CARRIAGE; inside is CHO CHANG and several
GIRLFRIENDS. As Cho spots Harry she hesitates...nods
shyly. Harry blanches--Ron and Hermione share a smile as
the carriage RATTLES away...
NEVILLE (O.S.)
Hi guys.
NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM joins them, holding a pulsing CACTUS.
HARRY, RON, HERMIONE
Hey Neville.
As the next carriage pulls up Harry turns toward it--and
finds himself face to face with a large skeletal horse
with pupil-less eyes and leathery wings: a THESTRAL.
Harry stares in amazement.
HARRY
What is it?
RON
What's what?
HARRY
That. Pulling the carriage.
Ron and Hermione share a concerned look.
HERMIONE
Nothing's pulling the carriage,
Harry. It's pulling itself--like
always.
Harry turns back to the Thestral, SNORTING STEAM. And
then a calm, dreamy voice speaks nearby:
28.
LUNA (O.S.)
You're not going mad...
INSIDE THE CARRIAGE an upside-down magazine (The
Quibbler) lowers to reveal LUNA LOVEGOOD, her wand tucked
behind her ear. She studies Harry with wistful
understanding, as if wanting to comfort him.
LUNA
(smiling sympathetically)
They've always pulled the carriages.
Ron raises a dubious eyebrow as the others exchange
glances...then shrug. Luna studies Harry as he climbs
into the carriage.
LUNA
You're Harry Potter.
HARRY
(grim)
Yeah, I know.
Neville carefully climbs in with his CACTUS.
LUNA
I don't know who you are.
NEVILLE
Oh, nobody, really.
HERMIONE
(climbing in)
No you're not; you're Neville
Longbottom. Everyone, this is
Loony Lov--
(mortified)
Luna Lovegood. She's in Ginny's
year, in Ravenclaw.
Mumbled "hi's" all around as an utterly unperturbed Luna
smiles, fingers her necklace of butterbeer corks.
Hermione tries to make amends.
HERMIONE
What an interesting necklace.
LUNA
Oh thank you! It's a charm actually.
(leans in, confides)
Keeps away the Nargles.
Hermione nods and smiles politely. Harry and Ron shoot
her an inquisitive glance; Hermione surreptitiously
shrugs--"no idea."
Luna looks wistfully out the window.
29.
LUNA
Hungry. I hope there's pudding.
As the carriage RATTLES off...
42 OMITTED 42
43 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 43
TRACK ALONG the HIGH TABLE, where PROFESSORS FLITWICK,
MCGONAGALL and SNAPE are all are looking distinctly
uncomfortable...
DUMBLEDORE
...We have two changes in staffing
this year. We are pleased to
welcome back Professor Grubbly-
Plank, who will be taking Care of
Magical Creatures while Professor
Hagrid is on temporary leave...
We reach an OVERSIZED EMPTY CHAIR--
AT THE GRYFFINDOR TABLE a troubled Harry looks inquiringly
at Hermione, who shrugs, equally concerned...
Continue TRACKING along the high table--where PROFESSOR
TRELAWNEY--myopically trying to spear pieces of kipper
with her fork--pauses to peer uncertainly at the person
dining beside her...
DUMBLEDORE
...We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts
teacher--Professor Dolores Umbridge.
REVEAL Umbridge--in pink Alice band and matching
cardigan--sitting beside Trelawney. Harry is stunned.
DUMBLEDORE (O.S.)
[I'm sure I'm not alone in saying
good luck, Professor...]
HERMIONE
You know her?
HARRY
She was at my hearing. She works
for Fudge.
DUMBLEDORE
...As usual, our Caretaker Mr.
Filch has asked me to remind you--
UMBRIDGE
Hem, hem.
30.
Umbridge rises, steps toward the podium. Momentarily
taken aback, Dumbledore politely yields the floor, to a
MURMUR of shocked surprise from both teachers and students.
UMBRIDGE
Thank you Headmaster, for those
kind words of welcome. And how
lovely to see all your bright
happy faces smiling up at me...
(the STUDENTS blink back,
nonplussed)
I'm sure we're all going to be
very good friends.
FRED/GEORGE
Oh that's likely...
The twins SNORT in amusement...but then their grins
wither under Umbridge's icy gaze. She briskly produces a
parchment, reads in a sing-song voice.
UMBRIDGE
The Ministry of Magic has always
considered the education of young
witches and wizards to be of vital
importance. The task of passing
down the ancient skills must be
undertaken with the utmost
seriousness. Although each
headmaster has brought something
new to this historic school...
A perfunctory nod at Dumbledore.
UMBRIDGE
...progress for progress's sake
must be discouraged. A balance
then, between old and new, between
permanence and change, between
tradition and innovation.
We think she's done--the students EXHALE--
UMBRIDGE
--Let us preserve what must be
preserved, perfect what can be
perfected--and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.
Hermione reacts with dawning alarm at this last...as
Umbridge smiles primly, abruptly turns and goes,
Dumbledore breaks the stunned silence by starting to clap,
but the applause that joins him is meager at best.
DUMBLEDORE
Thank you Professor Umbridge; that
was most...illuminating. As I was
saying, Mr. Filch has asked me...
31.
DUMBLEDORE (O.S.)
[...to remind you all that magic
is not permitted in corridors
between classes, nor are any
number of other things, all of
which can be checked on the
extensive list now fastened to Mr.
Filch's office door. First-years
ought to know that the Forest in
the grounds is out-of-bounds to
students--and a few of our older
students ought to know by now, too.
Tryouts for the house Quidditch
teams will take place on the first
weekend of next month...]
RON
Illuminating? What a load of waffle!
HERMIONE
There was important stuff hidden
in that waffle.
(off their confusion)
"Progress must be discouraged?"
"Prune practices that ought to be
prohibited?"
HARRY
What's it mean?
HERMIONE
It means the Ministry's interfering
at Hogwarts.
They all slowly look up at the smug, satisfied smile of
Dolores Umbridge, as she carefully adjusts her bow.
43A INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 43A
As Harry enters through the portrait hole the TALK in
the room quickly dies. DEAN THOMAS stands with SEAMUS
FINNIGAN, who holds a copy of the Daily Prophet. An
editorial is visible: A picture of Harry, the accompanying
headline POTTER magically becomes PLOTTER?
HARRY
Dean. Seamus. Good holiday?
DEAN THOMAS
All right. Better than Seamus's
anyway.
Seamus looks uneasily at Harry, then:
SEAMUS
Me Mam didn't want me to come back.
32.
HARRY
Why not?
SEAMUS
Well...I suppose because of you.
(Harry is stunned)
The Daily Prophet's been saying a
lot of things about you, Harry--
and Dumbledore as well...
HARRY
And your Mum believes them?
SEAMUS
Nobody knows what really happened
the night Cedric died...
HARRY
Then I guess you should read the
Prophet like your stupid mother--
it'll tell you everything you need
to know!
SEAMUS
Don't you have a go at my mother!
HARRY
I'll have a go at anyone who calls
me a liar--!
RON
(as he enters)
What's going on?
SEAMUS
He's mad is what's going on! Do
you believe the rubbish he's come
out with about You-Know-Who?
RON
As a matter of fact, I do! So
unless you want a fistful of
Weasley you'll shut your mouth!
(Seamus backs down)
Anyone else got a problem with
Harry?
NEVILLE
(quietly)
My Gran says it's the Daily Prophet
that's rubbish. She's canceled our
subscription.
He looks up at Harry, who manages an awkward nod, then
hurries up the stairs...
33.
44 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 44
Harry is at the window. After a moment Ron joins him.
RON
You all right?
HARRY
(quietly furious)
Fine.
RON
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
But he'll come round, you'll see--
HARRY
I said I'm fine, Ron!
Ron stares at Harry. Harry's eyes are instantly
apologetic...but something prevents him from saying the
words. A complicated moment between the old friends. Ron
sees the helpless look in Harry's eyes, but can't help
being hurt.
RON
Right. I'll just leave you to your
thoughts, then.
He goes. Harry looks out the window...
45 INT. UMBRIDGE'S CLASSROOM - DAY 45
A paper SWALLOW swoops and dives overhead. It is before
class; STUDENTS buzz with CHATTER and horseplay. As the
SWALLOW banks around we see it is being expertly
controlled by the wand of PADMA PATIL...
The SWALLOW soars low over the class...then suddenly
EXPLODES in a ball of flame.
Dead silence. All eyes turn to Umbridge as she slowly
lowers her stubby wand, smiles a honeyed smile.
UMBRIDGE
Good morning, children!
As she strides to the front of the room she aims her wand
at a BLACKBOARD, flicks her wrist causing words to
magically appear (stacked vertically) as she speaks them:
UMBRIDGE
Ordinary. Wizarding. Level.
Examinations...

is not an understatement to say
your fifth-year examinations will

34.
UMBRIDGE (CONT'D)
in many respects determine your
futures. Study hard and you will
be rewarded! Fail to do so, and
the consequences may be...severe.
The remains of the singed swallow COLLAPSES into ash.
A stack of TEXTBOOKS now FLOAT out of a cupboard and
distribute themselves to the students, landing with a
thud before them: "Dark Arts Defense: Basics for
Beginners" over an outdated, childish illustration.
UMBRIDGE
Your previous instruction in this
subject has been disturbingly...
uneven. But you will be pleased to
know that from now on you will be
following a carefully structured,
Ministry-approved course of
defensive magic...
Hermione has been paging through the textbook with
growing alarm. She raises her hand. Umbridge nods.
HERMIONE
There's nothing in here about
actually using defensive spells.
UMBRIDGE
(the silvery laugh)
Using spells? I can't imagine why
you would need to use spells in my
classroom.
RON
(incredulous)
We're not going to use magic?
Umbridge ignores him, calls on Hermione's upthrust hand.
HERMIONE
But surely the whole point of
Defense Against the Dark Arts--
UMBRIDGE
Wizards much older and cleverer
than yourself have devised our new
program of study. You will be
learning about defensive spells in
a secure, risk-free way...
HARRY
What use is that? If we're going
to be attacked it won't be "risk
free--"
35.
UMBRIDGE
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.
(instantly sweet)
It is the view of the Ministry
that a theoretical knowledge will
be sufficient to get you through
your examinations--which, after
all, is what school is all about.
HARRY
And how's theory's supposed to
prepare us for what's out there?
UMBRIDGE
There is nothing out there, dear.
Who do you imagine wants to attack
children like yourself?
HARRY
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord
Voldemort?
Hermione cringes. Umbridge freezes...then turns, splays
her fingers on her desk as she surveys the room.
UMBRIDGE
Let me make this quite plain. You
have been told that a certain Dark
wizard is at large once again.
This is a lie.
HARRY
It's not a lie. I saw him, I
fought him--
UMBRIDGE
Detention, Mr. Potter!
HARRY
So according to you, Cedric Diggory
dropped dead of his own accord?
UMBRIDGE
Cedric Diggory's death was a
tragic accident.
HARRY
It was murder. Voldemort killed
him and you know it--!
UMBRIDGE
(volcanic)
ENOUGH!
The entire class FLINCHES--but in an instant the glimmer
of madness vanishes from Umbridge's eye, and she has
completely regained her poise. Sweetly:
36.
UMBRIDGE
Enough.

As we PAN BACK to Harry's reflection it again crosses

PINK SLIPPER...she follows it up myopically to find
Umbridge's face--jumps back in fright--
TRELAWNEY
Oh! What are you doing here?
UMBRIDGE
Oh don't mind me, dear...
(she begins searching
through her BAG)
You see--Professor Trelawney,
isn't it?--in addition to my
teaching duties, the Ministry has
asked me to act as an informal
observer here at Hogwarts...
(incensed, Trelawney
draws breath to protest)
Cornelius' eyes and ears, as it
were...
The silvery LAUGH as she produces a PARCHMENT [Educational
Decree Number 12], which Trelawney blinks at uneasily.
IN THE RISERS Harry frowns...
UMBRIDGE
Nothing whatsoever to worry about
of course. Please, do go on. I'm
just a fly on the wall...
Trelawney hesitates...finally turns back to the class.
TRELAWNEY
Yes. Well--
UMBRIDGE
Just one question dear. You've
been in this post how long exactly?
TRELAWNEY
Nearly sixteen years.
UMBRIDGE
Quite a period...And it was
Dumbledore who appointed you?
TRELAWNEY
He did.
Umbridge produces a CLIPBOARD, makes a SQUEAKY note.
Trelawney can't help trying to peek but Umbridge pulls
it away....nods for her to continue. Trelawney again
starts to speak--double checks Umbridge--finally begins--
UMBRIDGE
Just one more thing. If it isn't
too much bother, would you please...
predict something for me?
38.
Trelawney freezes. IN THE RISERS the STUDENTS shift
uncomfortably. Harry frowns--he sees where this is going.
TRELAWNEY
Sorry?
UMBRIDGE
Predict something. Surely you're
not surprised I ask. You would
have foreseen it--no?
TRELAWNEY
The--the Inner Eye does not See
upon command!
UMBRIDGE
Come now, one teensy little
prophecy...No? Pity.
Umbridge raises her pen to make a note--Trelawney panics--
TRELAWNEY
I...I think I do see something...
something dark...
(a shaking finger rises)
You are in grave danger!
Umbridge raises a bland eyebrow...and makes a note. OFF
HARRY--
46D INT. SNAPE'S CLASSROOM - DAY 46D
Snape glowers from the front of his classroom, his eyes
tracking back and forth...
UMBRIDGE (O.S.)
...you applied first for the
Defense Against the Dark Arts Post,
is that correct?
Umbridge, clipboard in hand, serenely paces the back of
the room. Hermione watches, frowns with growing concern.
SNAPE
Yes.
UMBRIDGE
But you were unsuccessful...?
SNAPE
Obviously.
Ron and Harry share a covert smile--Snape CUFFS Ron on
the head.
39.
UMBRIDGE
Do you have any idea why Dumbledore
has consistently refused to appoint
you?
SNAPE
I suggest you ask him.
UMBRIDGE
(sweetly)
Oh, I shall. In fact...
(her eyes fall on Harry)
I believe I may have quite a lot
to say to your esteemed
Headmaster...in due time.
Snape raises a surprised eyebrow, as the class reacts to
this ominous note. Hermione frowns deeply--turns to look
at Harry, who turns to take in Umbridge's cold smile.
Harry SHIVERS--
46E OMITTED 46E
47 INT. UMBRIDGE'S OFFICE - DUSK 47
Umbridge tips a heaping spoonful of sugar into her tea.
Another. Another. Finally takes a SLURP, smacks her lips.
A KNOCK at the door. Umbridge pauses to minutely adjust
the row of razor-sharp pencils lying before a framed
PUBLICITY PHOTO of Fudge--striving to look dashing but
only managing to look constipated. She gets the pencils
just so, then:
UMBRIDGE
Come in.
Harry enters--and stops, transfixed.
The Dark Arts Office has been transformed into a
nightmare in pink. The surfaces have been draped in lacy
cloth; the walls are covered with ENCHANTED ORNAMENTAL
PLATES with playful technicolor KITTENS.
UMBRIDGE
Good evening, Mr. Potter. You know
why you are here?
HARRY
Pink. Er...yes.
(a brief internal
struggle)
For talking back to a teacher...
Umbridge raises an impressed eyebrow. But as she turns
away Harry can't resist adding, soto:
40.
HARRY
And telling the truth.
UMBRIDGE
(a slow smile)
I'm the teacher, dear. I'll decide
what the truth is.
She indicates a desk against the wall; Harry sits.
UMBRIDGE
You are going to be doing some
lines for me today, Mr. Potter.
(Harry opens his bag)
No, not with your quill. You're
going to be using a rather special
one of mine.
From behind her back she produces a long black quill with
a razor-sharp point, hands it to Harry.
UMBRIDGE
Now: I want you to write 'I must
not tell lies.'
HARRY
How many times?
UMBRIDGE
Oh, let's say for as long as it
takes for the message to sink in.
She starts back to her desk, as Harry realizes:
HARRY
You haven't given me any ink.
UMBRIDGE
Oh, you won't need ink.
Uneasy, Harry begins to write. After a few words he stops,
gasping in pain--
The words "I must not" have appeared on the parchment in
gleaming red--and at the same time on the back of Harry's
hand, as if cut into his skin with a scalpel.
Harry stares as the cut magically heals over, leaving a
faint trace of lettering on his reddened flesh. As Harry
turns to stare at Umbridge she raises an eyebrow.
UMBRIDGE
Yes?
HARRY
(a long beat, then)
Nothing.
A spark of understanding dawns in Umbridge's eyes.
41.
UMBRIDGE
That's right. Because deep down,
you know you deserve to be punished.
Don't you, Mr. Potter...
Harry stares as a disturbing, strangely intimate moment
passes between them. Umbridge nods for him to continue.
Harry begins to write, wincing in pain as the bloody
letters glisten on the parchment...
48 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 48
A WIZARD'S WIRELESS blares the latest hit from Celestina
Warbeck.
FIND Neville sitting before his CACTUS. Using a quill
pen, he surgically prods one of its PULSATING BOILS--
which promptly ERUPTS with thick green STINKSAP, covering
Neville's face. He grimaces, sighs.
Just beyond, Fred and George Weasley flank NIGEL, a young
second-year. Fred holds a bright orange CANDY BOX; both
he and George are focused intently on Nigel, slowly
chewing and turning chartreuse. Beyond we may notice
other VICTIMS in various forms of distress: nosebleeds,
dizziness, violent sneezing, unconsciousness...
FRED
...oh, now he's feeling it!
(Nigel looks alarmed)
Get it? Skiving snackboxes!
GEORGE
Sweets to make you ill!
FRED
Get out of class whenever you like!
GEORGE
Extract hours of leisure from
unprofitable boredom!
FRED
Care for another?
As Nigel races off to vomit George and Fred high-five.
FIND Ron and Hermione entering, mid-conversation.
RON
...I'm not asking you to write all
of it for me, just...most of it.
HERMIONE
All right; I'll do the
introduction--but that's all.
42.
RON
Hermione you are honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met and
if I'm ever rude to you again--
HERMIONE
I'll know you're back to normal.
They approach the fireplace, where Harry sits doing
homework. He instinctively has the raw back of his hand
to his mouth. Hermione is instantly maternal.
HERMIONE
What's wrong with your hand?
HARRY
(quickly hiding it)
Nothing.
Hermione's steely gaze will brook no quarter. Harry sighs,
holds out his hand.
HERMIONE
The other hand...
Harry reluctantly complies. Ron and Hermione stare.
HERMIONE
You've got to tell Dumbledore.
HARRY
(uneasy)
NO...I mean...Dumbledore's got
enough on his mind right now...
Anyway I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.
RON
Bloody hell Harry, the woman's
torturing you! If the parents knew
about this--!
HARRY
Well I haven't got any of those,
have I Ron!
HERMIONE
Harry...You've got to report this.
It's a simple matter of--
HARRY
No it's not!
Hermione reacts, surprised. Straining for measured tones,
Harry struggles to explain:
HARRY
Hermione...Whatever's going on
here...it isn't simple.
43.
Ron and Hermione stare at him. Harry shakes his head.
HARRY
You don't understand.
HERMIONE
Then help us to.
Harry looks at her helplessly...then rises, goes.
Distressed, Ron and Hermione look after him...
REVEAL Neville on the balcony above, a towel to his face,
frowning. He's overheard it all.

49 EXT. SKY ABOVE HOGWARTS - EARLY MORNING 49
CRISP BLUE SKY. As HEDWIG drops into FRAME, soars toward
us, the PARCHMENT fixed to her leg fills the screen...
HARRY (V.O.)
Dear Padfoot. I hope you're all
right...It's starting to get
colder here; winter is definitely
on the way...
As Hedwig drops down to skim the treetops we spot Harry
approaching Hagrid's Hut. He frowns up at the shuttered
windows and dormant chimney.
HARRY (V.O.)
...In spite of being back at
Hogwarts I feel more alone than
ever. I know you of all people
will understand...
A distant WHINNY draws Harry's attention toward the
Forbidden Forest...where a THESTRAL rises high above the
treetops, soars in a great circle then plunges out of
sight.
50 EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - CLEARING - EARLY MORNING 50
Several THESTRALS are gathered around Luna, who is gently
petting them. She has a smudge of dirt on her nose. As
Harry cautiously approaches she speaks without looking up.
LUNA
Hello, Harry Potter.
Startled, Harry moves to join her. As he shivers in the
early morning air he notices her feet are bare.
44.
HARRY
Your feet--aren't they...cold?
LUNA
A bit. Unfortunately all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared...
(leans in; low:)
I suspect Nargles are behind it.
Harry nods uncertainly. A BABY THESTRAL approaches; Luna
produces an APPLE, gently rolls it toward him. The BABY
sniffs it, ignores it.
HARRY
What are they?
LUNA
They're called Thestrals. They're
quite gentle, really, but most
people avoid them because they're
a bit...
HARRY
Different.
(Luna nods. A moment)
But...why couldn't the others see
them?
LUNA
They can only be seen by people
who have seen death.
HARRY
(murmurs)
Cedric...
(then)
You've known someone who's died,
then?
LUNA
My Mum. She was quite an
extraordinary witch, but she did
like to experiment. One day one of
her spells went rather badly wrong.
I was nine.
HARRY
I'm sorry.
LUNA
(conversationally)
Yes, it was rather horrible. I
still feel very sad about it
sometimes. But, I've got Dad. We
both believe you, by the way.
(off Harry's confusion)
That He Who Must Not Be Named is
back and you fought him and now
(MORE)
45.
LUNA (CONT'D)
the Ministry is conspiring with
the Daily Prophet against you and
Dumbledore.
HARRY
Um...Thanks. Seems you're about
the only one.
LUNA
Oh, I don't think that's true...
Luna reaches into a bag and produces a piece of RAW MEAT;
gently tosses it toward the BABY THESTRAL, who happily
catches it in mid-air.
LUNA
...But I suppose that's how he
wants you to feel.
HARRY
What do you mean?
LUNA
Well if I were You-Know-Who...I'd
want you to be cut off from
everyone else. Because if it's
just you alone... you're not as
much of a threat.
Harry stares at Luna. The BABY nuzzles her as she looks
up at Harry with a radiant smile.
51 INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING 51
Ron is reading "How to Soar on Your OWLS" as he shovels
down food at lightning speed and top volume. Hermione
watches with a look somewhere between awe and disgust.
HERMIONE
Don't you ever stop eating?
RON
Wha'? Ah'm 'ungry...
Suddenly he looks beyond her; swallows:
RON
Harry.
Hermione turns to see a vulnerable, contrite Harry.
HARRY
All right if I join you?
Hermione smiles uncertainly...and then RAISED VOICES are
heard outside the hall--
46.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL (O.S.)
...and once brought to my attention
I felt it my duty to speak out.
UMBRIDGE (O.S.)
Speak out? I'm afraid I don't
understand...
52 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 52
The reunited trio exits the Great Hall to investigate.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL (O.S.)
Come now, you must admit such
behavior is irregular to say the
least. Furthermore--
UMBRIDGE (O.S.)
Pardon me Professor, but what
exactly are you insinuating...?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL (O.S.)
I am "insinuating" nothing...
McGonagall and Umbridge are on the Marble Stair.
McGonagall is clearly uncomfortable with the public
nature of the conversation.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
...I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students, you
conform to prescribed disciplinary
practices...
Harry notices Neville among the gathering CROWD; he meets
Harry's eye with a look of guilty defiance. As Harry's
surprise softens into gratitude, Neville shrugs shyly.
UMBRIDGE
So silly of me, but it sounds as
though you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom...
(taking a deliberate step
up)
...Minerva.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Not at all...
(stepping up as well)
Dolores. Merely your medieval
methods.
Umbridge looks at McGonagall with sadness and pity.
47.
UMBRIDGE
I am sorry dear...but to question
my practices is to question the
Ministry--and, by extension, the
Minister himself. I am a tolerant
woman, but the one thing I can't
stand for is disloyalty.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Disloyalty--?
The trio reacts. Umbridge looks out at the students, as
we PUSH IN...
UMBRIDGE
Things at Hogwarts are far worse
than I feared. Cornelius will want
to take immediate action...
52A INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NOTICE AREA - DAY 52A
CLANG--An IRON SPIKE is hammered into stone, attaching a
NOTICE to the wall: Educational Decree Number 23: Dolores
Jane Umbridge has been appointed to the post of Hogwarts
High Inquisitor.
Filch cracks his neck, grimly satisfied...steps back as
STUDENTS move in to read the LONE NOTICE on the huge
expanse of empty wall. PAN to find the troubled trio,
Hermione fearfully reading a copy of the
53 DAILY PROPHET 53
A BANNER HEADLINE reads: MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL
REFORM, and, below: "New Era Dawns at Hogwarts." As we
DESCEND into the paper the PAGE TURNS--WHOOSH--to reveal
a moving photo of FUDGE, trailed by a mob of REPORTERS
as he strides through the Ministry Atrium.
FUDGE
--Having already revolutionised
the teaching of Defense Against
the Dark Arts, Dolores Umbridge
will, as High Inquisitor, now have
powers to address the seriously
slipping standards at Hogwarts
School--
Again we are falling into the pages--WHOOSH--the PAGE
TURNS, as we FLY past various other STORIES--"CENTAUR
CRISIS CONTINUES," subheaded "Treaty Talks Break Down"--
and ADVERTISEMENTS--"Magical Savings on last years
models!"--to FIND a sidebar story: "PARENTS ENDORSE
MINISTRY MOVE." A moving PHOTO of LUCIUS MALFOY, sits
holding a brandy by the fire in his Wiltshire Mansion,
appeals to us with oleaginous sincerity:
48.
LUCIUS MALFOY
As a parent, I believe the Ministry
is doing what's best for all our
sakes...
(emotionally)
For the sake of the children.
NOTE: Scenes 46C and 46D [Trelawney and Snape inspections]
to be relocated HERE.
53A INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 53A
As the COMPOSER tries to conduct his CHOIR, Umbridge
circles him, making notes. She matter-of-factly produces
a TAPE MEASURE. As it magically unspools to measure him,
the Composer tries to bear the humiliation with as much
grace as possible.
53B INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT CORRIDOR - DAY 53B
Between classes, a familiar young COUPLE KISSES in an
alcove--when suddenly a BLUE ELECTRIC ARC zaps their lips,
BLOWING THEM APART. Umbridge's eyes narrow in
satisfaction...as the two kids EXHALE in surprise--and
SMOKE comes out of their mouths.
53C INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NOTICE AREA - DAY 53C
CLANG: Educational Decree No. 22: "Boys and girls are
not permitted to be within 8 inches of each other."
A small GROUP of STUDENTS gather, frown...
53D EXT. COURTYARD - DUSK 53D
In a shadowy area off the courtyard (the better to see
the effects) Fred and George display their latest wares
to a group of KIDS: FIREWORK SPARKLER BALLS in vivid
colors. Like YO-YOs with invisible strings, the twins do
a variety of tricks in tandem, sending them in wide arcs
around their heads (kids DUCKING out of the way just in
time), letting them COLLIDE (at which point they EXPLODE,
CHANGE COLOR and become BIGGER). Finally they detach from
their "strings" altogether as the twins JUGGLE them in a
fiery cascade, to the KIDS' applause...
Suddenly, to the Twins' surprise, the balls FIZZLE and
SPUTTER as they're SUCKED through the air--
--and hoovered up into UMBRIDGE'S stubby wand. Umbridge
raises a challenging eyebrow at the twins--
49.
53E INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NOTICE AREA - DAY 53E
CLANG: Educational Decree No. 21: All Weasley Products
will be banned immediately.
The GROUP of STUDENTS grows larger, more disturbed...
53F INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT CORRIDOR - ANOTHER DAY 53F
A group of STUDENTS with their shirt-tails out and their
ties loosened are LAUGHING boisterously as they walk down
the hall between classes....
...not noticing UMBRIDGE walking the other way. Her eyes
narrow in deep disdain as her stubby wand emerges--she
FLICKS her wrist--
--as magically the Students shirt-tails TUCK THEMSELVES
IN--rather violently--and their ties TIGHTEN abruptly,
CHOKING off their laughter. Umbridge smiles--
53G INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NOTICE AREA - ANOTHER DAY 53G
CLANG: Educational Decree No. 27: Proper Dress and
Decorum is to be maintained at all times.
MORE PROCLAMATIONS go up in rapid succession, too quick
to read--
CLANG: Any literature by non-Wizards or Half-breeds is
banned, forthwith.
CLANG: Students must consent to have their post checked
for illegal contraband.
CLANG: Any complaints about Hogwarts or its staff must
be made in writing to the High Inquisitor.
CLANG. All Quidditch matches are hereby canceled.
Broomsticks will be turned in to the High Inquisitor for
safe-keeping.
PULL BACK to reveal Filch--who now has to use a rickety
STEP-STOOL to reach open wall...
BOOM down to find the TRIO staring up at the increasingly
cluttered wall, surrounded by the largest GROUP yet--
--as in the distance we hear a growing COMMOTION--
something big is up. A group of STUDENTS rushes by, Cho
among them.
HARRY
Cho--what's going on?
CHO
It's Professor Trelawney.

58 EXT. COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS 58
THUNDER RUMBLES as Harry pushes through a great ring of
ONLOOKERS to join Ron and Hermione. It seems like most
of the student body is circled around a wild-eyed, wind-
blown Trelawney--a Crystal Ball clutched in one hand, an
empty sherry bottle in the other. Two large trunks lay
on the ground beside Filch, his arms crossed.
TRELAWNEY
S-Sixteen years I've lived and
taught here! H- Hogwarts is m-my
h-home! You c-can't do this!
REVERSE to reveal Umbridge approaching through a silently
parting sea of STUDENTS.
UMBRIDGE
Actually...
(holding up a DECREE)
...I can.
Professor McGonagall now hurries to Trelawney, hands her
a large handkerchief. Trelawney blows her nose as
McGonagall looks daggers at Umbridge.
UMBRIDGE
Something you'd like to say, dear?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
Oh, there are several things I'd
like to say.
With a CRACK the oaken front doors swing wide--revealing
a dangerously composed Dumbledore. All eyes on him, he
approaches Trelawney; murmurs in her ear. She actually
51.
manages a small smile. Umbridge fumes, opens her mouth
to speak--
DUMBLEDORE
Professor McGonagall...might I ask
you to escort Sybill back inside?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL
(eyeing Umbridge)
Happy to.
UMBRIDGE
Dumbledore: May I remind you that
under the terms of Educational
Decree Number Twenty-three, as
enacted by the Minister--!
DUMBLEDORE
--you have the right to dismiss my
teachers. You do not, however,
have the authority to banish them
from the grounds. That power
remains with the Headmaster.
UMBRIDGE
(pausing)
For now.
A charged moment between she and Dumbledore--the gloves
are off. Dumbledore nods to Professor McGonagall, who
takes Trelawney's trembling arm, guides her back inside.
DUMBLEDORE
I trust you all have studying to do?
The CROWD OF STUDENTS quickly break up. In the tumult
Harry desperately tries to reach Dumbledore.
HARRY
Professor? Professor--!
But Dumbledore seems not to hear him. Harry has almost
caught up as Dumbledore rounds a pillar--and vanishes.
FAT DROPS of rain begins to fall as we CRANE UP over
Harry: frozen, lost. The WIND RISES; THUNDER BUILDS...
59 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 59
LIGHTNING FLASHES; RAIN POUNDS against the window.
Hermione paces wildly as Harry and Ron watch her stalk
back and forth like spectators at a tennis match.
HERMIONE
That foul, evil old gargoyle!
We've got to do something!
52.
RON
(confused)
I thought you hated Trelawney...
HERMIONE
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, RON! We're
not learning how to defend
ourselves, we're not learning what
we need to pass our OWLS, she's
taking over the entire school--
what's Dumbledore playing at?
HARRY
(murmurs)
I wish I knew...
The WIZARD'S WIRELESS on the side table CRACKLES to life.
ANNOUNCER
At the witching hour, here are the
latest headlines...Cornelius Fudge
today denied rumors that the
mysterious disappearance of several
Ministry workers is related to
last year's appearance of the Dark
Mark at the Quidditch World Cup...
Ron starts to say something but Hermione immediately
SHUSHES him. Ron just sighs, shakes his head as she
hurries to turn up the volume, and he and Harry join her.
ANNOUNCER
...With increased incidents of
Goblin unrest as well as rumblings
among the Giants, the Minister
sought to quell the qualms of the
wizard world:
FUDGE (O.S.)
We wish to assure the public that
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.
Furthermore, we have convincing
evidence these disappearances are
the work of notorious mass murderer
Sirius Black. Make no mistake: we
will hunt him down and find him
wherever he hides...
SIRIUS (O.S.)
Come and get me, Fudgey...
SIRIUS' HEAD appears in the fire's dancing flames. As
his face eerily BURNS and REFORMS the trio rush to kneel
on the hearthrug.
HARRY
Sirius! What are you doing here?
53.
SIRIUS
Answering your letter. You said
you were worried about Umbridge.
What's she doing, training you all
to kill half breeds?
HARRY
Half-breeds? What are you talking
about?
HERMIONE
I've been reading up on her--
Umbridge loathes part-humans of
any kind. At the Ministry she was
infamous for it--anti-werewolf
legislation, imposing territorial
restrictions on Centaurs...
HARRY
Sirius, she's not letting us use
magic at all.
SIRIUS
I might have guessed. Latest
intelligence is Fudge doesn't want
you trained in combat.
RON
Combat? What does he think, we're
forming some sort of wizard army?
SIRIUS
That's exactly what he thinks--
that Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the Ministry.
He's getting more paranoid by the
minute...
The gravity of this sinks in. Sirius hesitates.
SIRIUS
The others wouldn't want me telling
you this, Harry ...but things
aren't going at all well with the
Order. Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...and these
"disappearances" are just how it
started last time. Voldemort is on
the move.
HARRY
What can we do, Sirius?
SIRIUS
I'm not sure...I do know your Dad
never would have lain down for the
likes of Umbridge.
(MORE)
54.
SIRIUS (CONT'D)
(Harry takes this in)
Someone's coming. Sorry I can't be
more help, but for now at least...
(grimaces, concerned)
...looks like you're on your own.
His face turns to ASH and vanishes.
THUNDER CRACKS; LIGHTNING FLASHES. Hermione goes to the
window, shivers.
HERMIONE
He really is out there, isn't he.
Harry and Ron join her. The trio look out at the
increasingly violent storm.
HERMIONE
We've got to be able to defend
ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses
to teach us how...
(turning to Harry)
We need someone who will.
Ron looks up in dawning comprehension. They both look at
Harry--LIGHTNING FLASHES--
60 REVERSE 60
We PULL BACK THROUGH the window as Ron and Hermione fall
on Harry, talking with greater and greater animation--as
Harry looks more and more dubious. THUNDER CRACKS as
SHEETS OF RAIN obscure the castle from view...
...and now as the wind spirals us wildly upward,
LIGHTNING suddenly illuminates a towering CLOUD FORMATION
that looks eerily like Voldemort's head. The WIND
HOWLS...and BECOMES THE WHISPERS FROM HARRY'S DREAMS as
we are propelled TOWARD it, THROUGH its gaping MOUTH...
As the rain CRYSTALLIZES into SNOW and night BRIGHTENS
into day, the wind bears us toward Hogsmeade Village...
61 EXT. MAIN STREET - HOGSMEADE VILLAGE - DAY 61
The trio hurries through the slushy SNOW. Harry,
shivering, is visibly nervous.
HARRY
This is mad. Who'd want to be
taught by me? I'm a nutter,
remember?
RON
Look on the bright side--you can't
be any worse than old toad-face.
55.
HARRY
(stares, then)
Thanks, Ron.
RON
I'm here for you, mate.
62 INT. HOG'S HEAD INN - DAY 62
A mounted BOAR'S HEAD turns as the door CREAKS open. The
trio peers into the dingy room, lit by stubby candles on
rough wooden tables. Ron sniffs at the sour air.
RON
Lovely spot.
HERMIONE
I thought it'd be safer someplace
off the beaten track.
The BARMAN (ABERFORTH DUMBLEDORE) peers goatishly at them
as he wipes glasses with a filthy rag.
HARRY
Who's supposed to be meeting us?
HERMIONE
Oh, just a couple of people...
(looks around the deserted
pub)
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Harry frowns...and then Hermione brightens as the door
opens and a crowd of STUDENTS hurries in: Neville, Ginny,
Fred and George, Cho, Luna, the young second-year Nigel,
PARVATI and PADMA PATIL, a SLIGHTLY CREEPY BOY, a
SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY, and a dozen OTHERS stand looking
around the gloom.
HARRY
A couple of people?
Hermione smiles weakly. As the group gathers there is
uneasiness on both sides; some of the students have
openly challenging expressions; others are more curious.
Harry spots Cho's uncertain smile; flushes.
HERMIONE
Um--hi. So, you all know why we're
here. We need a teacher--a proper
teacher, one who's had real
experience defending themselves
against the Dark Arts--
SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY
Why?
56.
RON
Why? Because You-Know-Who is back,
you tosspot!
SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY
(a nod at Harry)
So he says.
HERMIONE
So Dumbledore says--
SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY
So Dumbledore said because he says.
The point is, where's the proof?
SLIGHTLY CREEPY BOY
If Potter could tell us more about
how Diggory got killed...
Cho stands perfectly still, refusing to cry.
HARRY
I'm not going to talk about Cedric.
So if that's what you're here for,
you might as well clear out now.
A flash of gratitude from Cho; Harry turns to Hermione:
HARRY
Let's go. They're just here because
they think I'm some sort of freak--
HERMIONE
(desperate)
Harry, wait--
LUNA (O.S.)
Is it true you can produce a
Patronus Charm?
The crowd grows quiet. Harry spots Luna standing in the
back. Hermione seizes the opening.
HERMIONE
Yes. I've seen it. A fully-formed
stag Patronus.
DEAN THOMAS
Blimey Harry! I never knew that!
NEVILLE
He--he also killed a Basilisk--
with the sword in Dumbledore's
office!
GINNY
It's true.
The crowd is impressed. The tide is beginning to turn.
57.
RON
And third year he fought off about
a hundred Dementors at once--
HERMIONE
And last year he did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh--
HARRY
Wait.
All eyes swing to Harry. He is struggling mightily with
this. Finally, speaking to both his friends and the group:
HARRY
Look--it all sounds great when you
say it like that. But the truth is,
a lot of it was luck. I didn't
know what I was doing half the
time, I nearly always had help--
HERMIONE
(quickly)
He's just being modest.
HARRY
No, Hermione. I'm not.
(to the group)
Facing this stuff in real life...it
isn't like school at all. In
school, if you make a mistake you
can just...try again tomorrow. But
out there...
(haunted)
...when you're a second away from
being murdered...or watching a
friend die right before your eyes...
He falters as his eyes fall on Cho, her eyes brimming.
HARRY
You just...you don't know what
it's like.
The group is silent. Hermione looks at Harry; chastened.
HERMIONE
You're right Harry. We don't.
That's why we need your help.
Because if we're to have any
chance of beating V-Voldemort...
It's the first time she's said his name. Harry looks at
her, then the group. Young Nigel, scared, looks up at
Harry. In a small voice:
NIGEL
He really is back?
58.
Harry nods. The group looks solemnly back...and it
strikes us their arrangement is quite reminiscent of the
photo of the original Order. Harry realizes, murmurs...
HARRY
We're the young ones now.
SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY hesitates...then silently steps
forward...and nods--"I'm in." Harry's eyes fall on Nigel,
gazing at him almost worshipfully--and the responsibility
of what he's taking on sinks in.
One by one the OTHERS step forward; Ron and Hermione
exchange shivery glances--there is an air of destiny
about the moment. The SUN breaks through clouds,
brightening even the pub's grimy windows...as the BARMAN
winces grumpily...
INSERT: A PIECE OF PARCHMENT with the words DUMBLEDORE'S
ARMY written in bold letters across the top. One by one
one the students sign their names.
HARRY (O.S.)
...all right--next thing is to
find a place to practice where
Umbridge won't find out--
63 EXT. BRIDGE/CLOCKTOWER BRIDGE - DAY 63
We SOAR toward the bridge. FIND the trio, flanked by
Ginny and Neville. They walk purposefully toward us,
their excitement palpable.
GINNY
The Shrieking Shack?
HARRY
Too small.
HERMIONE
The Forbidden Forest?
RON
Not bloody likely.
GINNY
Harry...What happens if Umbridge
does find out?
HERMIONE
(a bit giddy)
Oh, who cares. I mean, it's sort
of exciting, isn't it? Breaking
the rules?
RON
Who are you, and what have you
done with Hermione Granger?
59.
HERMIONE
(flushes)
Anyway...we know at least one
positive thing came from today.
HARRY
What's that?
HERMIONE
(grinning)
Cho just couldn't keep her eyes
off you, could she...
Harry turns pink as Ron beams, slaps him on the back.
Ginny, however, doesn't seem quite as pleased...
HARRY
Okay: in the next few days each of
us comes up with a couple of
possibilities for places to
practice...
As the others nod we MOVE IN ON Neville, his brow creased
in concentration...
63A EXT. TOWER - DAY - CONTINUOUS 63A
Umbridge's eyes narrow in deep suspicion as she watches
the kids from on high...and then her face hardens into
determination. As she turns to FILCH standing beside her,
she WHISPERS in his ear...until his dimly confused
expression hardens as well.
64 OMITTED 64
64A OMITTED 64A
64B INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT CORRIDOR - DAY 64B
Neville, still deep in thought, almost bumps into Draco
Malfoy walking the other way.
DRACO MALFOY
Watch where you're going,
Longbottom...
Draco sneers, moves on, as Neville hurries around the
corner...
As he walks past a blank section of wall he abruptly
halts. Slowly turns, goes back...and now where the plain
stone wall was, a HIGHLY FILIGREED DOOR has appeared.
Neville hesitates, opens it...
60.
65 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - DAY 65
Neville stares in amazement as he steps into the spacious
room lit with flickering torches. PAN across its
bookcase-lined walls, its floor covered with silk
cushions...
LIGHTS SHIFT/TIME LAPSES as we complete the PAN to reveal
Neville has been joined by the trio.
HERMIONE
You've done it, Neville! You've
found the Room of Requirement!
RON
The which?
HERMIONE
I've heard rumors about it for
ages but I never believed them
until now...!
(seeing their confusion)
It's also known as the Come and Go
room. The Room of Requirement only
appears when a person has real
need of it, and is always equipped
for the seekers' needs.
RON
So, say you really needed a
toilet...?
HERMIONE
Charming, Ronald. But yes, that's
the general idea.
HARRY
It's brilliant. Like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back...
Suddenly a glint of silver falls past Harry's face. Harry
smiles in amazement as he bends down and picks up a shiny
WHISTLE...holds it to his lips--BLOWS--
65A INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NOTICE AREA - DAY 65A
CLANG. Educational Decree No. 68: All Student
Organizations are henceforth disbanded. Any Student in
noncompliance will be expelled.
Filch turns sycophantically to Umbridge--who turns to
glare meaningfully at the assembled STUDENTS. We suddenly
move through the notice wall behind them--
66 OMITTED 66
61.
67 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - DAY 67
--into Harry's first class; the last of the STUDENTS
hurries into place. Harry is visibly nervous as he looks
down the line of eager faces. Hermione offers an
encouraging smile, Ron a covert fist of solidarity.
HARRY
All right...so...I was thinking
the first thing we should practice
is disarming charms...
SLIGHTLY CREEPY BOY
Isn't that sort of...basic?
HARRY
It saved my life last year.
An impressed MURMUR. Ron and Hermione exchange a happy
look...Harry exhales--he's begun.
A DEATH EATER
towers above us, its hideous skull-like MASK grinning.
PULL BACK to reveal it is a quite realistic-looking DUMMY,
its arms extended, one hand holding a prodigious bone WAND.
Uneasy STUDENTS stand in a line before it--Neville first.
He stares up at the Death Eater--takes a deep breath--
NEVILLE
Expelliarmus!
Neville's wand goes spinning out of his hand in a SHOWER
OF SPARKS--STUDENTS DUCK as it SHOOTS over their heads
and smashes against the wall. Harry frowns--this is going
to be harder than he thought. Neville sags in despair.
NEVILLE
I'm hopeless.
Harry hesitates--then, with determination:
HARRY
No you're not. You're just
flourishing your wand too much.
Here, try it like this--
Harry demonstrates with a sharp flick of his wrist...as
just beyond, Hermione and Ginny exchange an impressed
smile...
UMBRIDGE (O.S.)
...you will please copy the
approved text four times--
62.
67A INT. UMBRIDGE'S CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY 67A
ENCHANTED CHALK writes an endless list of defensive
theory minutiae on the blackboard. PULL BACK TO INCLUDE
Umbridge's dour face as she starts down the aisle,
watching students miserably open their notebooks.
UMBRIDGE
--to ensure maximum retention.
(the class GROANS)
There will be no need to talk.
As Umbridge passes Hermione she grips her pencil in
frustration, mutters:
HERMIONE
No need to think's more like it.
Umbridge stops--glares at her imperiously--then her eyes
widen in fury as she spots Neville intently practicing
the same wrist flick motion beyond.
UMBRIDGE
Wands away!
Neville nearly jumps out of his chair--Umbridge glowers
...then her eyes fall on Harry. She is disarmed to find
him looking evenly--even challengingly back at her--"I've
got a secret." Umbridge's eyes narrow suspiciously...
67B OMITTED 67B
67C INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT CORRIDOR - ANOTHER DAY 67C
Filch's rheumy eyes narrow in kind as he peers around a
corner--spots CHO with a small GROUP OF STUDENTS hurrying
down the corridor, looking around to make sure they're
not being watched...
Panting, Filch silently stalks them--quickly ducking
behind a SUIT OF ARMOR when Cho hears footsteps--waiting--
--then high-stepping it to hug the adjacent wall. He
peers slyly around the corner...just in time to see the
FILIGREED DOOR melting into stone. Filch smiles a curdled
smile as MRS. NORRIS leaps into his arms...
67C1 EXT. TOWER - DAY 67C1
Now Umbridge listens as Filch whispers in her ear. She
listens, intrigued...and more determined than ever.
HARRY (O.S.)
Stunning is one of the most useful
spells in your arsenal...
67D OMITTED 67D

68 OMITTED 68
69 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT 69
The class has formed an elongated circle. Harry stands
towards one end. His confidence has clearly grown.
HARRY
....it's sort of a wizard's bread
and butter, really...
Students LAUGH appreciatively; as Harry turns we see who
he's squared off against--a very nervous Nigel. Harry
smiles encouragingly:
HARRY
It's all right, Nigel. Take your
best shot.
Nigel takes a deep breath, then--
NIGEL
STUPEFY!
A JET of RED LIGHT leaps from Nigel's wand--sending Harry
FLYING twenty feet through the air! But Nigel goes
sprawling too--not used to the KICKBACK from his wand.
Fortunately the stone floor DEFORMS into PILLOWY SHAPES,
cushioning Nigel's landing completely.
Harry and an awed Nigel blink at each other from across
the floor--Harry grins.
HARRY
Not bad. Next--
A LITTLE LATER. Ron and Hermione are up; they step
forward together, both feeling a bit awkward. BOYS and
GIRLS silently gravitate towards their respective
champion--Ginny and Luna silently rooting for Hermione,
Dean and Neville for Ron--who confides quietly to Hermione:
RON
Don't worry--I'll go easy on you.
HERMIONE
(playing along)
Oh, thank you, Ronald.
They take their positions--both take a deep breath--
HERMIONE/RON
STUPEFY!
Hermione's wand emits a JET of RED LIGHT--sending Ron
soaring through the air and slamming--OOF--against the
mirror wall. He stares up at a slightly abashed Hermione,
64.
who is instantly surrounded by happy GIRLS. Ron turns to
the silent, stone-faced boys--
RON
I--I let her do that. I mean it's
just good manners, isn't it!
(the BOYS turn away,
GRUMBLING)
It was completely intentional--I'm
telling you--!
He turns helplessly to a grinning Harry--

69D EXT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 69D
Filch has staked out the wall with a little encampment;
cot, tea pot. As he keeps his drooping eyes on the wall
we PAN around the corner...where the FILIGREED DOOR
appears in a different wall, just out of Filch's view.
It opens; kids sneak silently out...
69D1 INT. UMBRIDGE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 69D1
Filch stands before Umbridge's desk, head hung low in
shame. Holding tight to one of her pencils, Umbridge
glowers at him--and SNAPS the pencil in two.
69E INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NOTICE AREA - DAY 69E
CLANG. Educational Decree No. 82: All Students will
submit to questioning about suspected illicit activities.
Filch, eyes red from lack of sleep, turns and glares.
70 INT. UMBRIDGE'S CLASSROOM/UMBRIDGE'S OFFICE - DAY 70
PULL PAST a LINE of NERVOUS STUDENTS waiting on the
stairs outside the Dark Arts office. The door opens and
a THIRD-YEAR GIRL emerges, shaken. A FOURTH-YEAR BOY,
next in line, peers uncertainly past her..where Umbridge
smiles a saccharine smile, taps the back of a waiting
chair as she stirs a cup of TEA...
70A-1 OMITTED 70A-1
70A-2 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - ANOTHER DAY 70A-2
TRACK behind a line of students, straining mightily with
trembling wands outstretched.

HARRY (O.S.)
Good...keep your concentration...
REVERSE to show their victims--the YOUNGER STUDENTS,
floating in mid-air. Harry walks alongside, gently
adjusting positions, wand angles.
HARRY
Little higher there...nice.
He reaches Cho, struggling to hold up Nigel, his eyes
pleading not to drop him. Harry gingerly puts his arms
around her to adjust her wand angle; as they touch, both
SHIVER, BLUSH--and Nigel tumbles wildly out frame. Fred
and George exchange a knowing grin...
...and as our view passes the WINDOWS reflected in the
MIRROR WALL, DAYLIGHT magically fades to NIGHT--
70A-3 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - ANOTHER NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 70A-3
--as the SHOT continues unbroken into another session.
[NOTE: Harry's dialogue begins over previous scene]
HARRY (V.O.)
Working hard is important...but
there's something that matters
even more: believing in yourself...
We FIND HARRY as he walks through the room of practicing
STUDENTS. Neville is still working on the elusive wrist
flick. STUDENTS pull BOOKS from shelves with ACCIO--as
Harry ducks just in time. Luna turns Dean Thomas' wand
into a bouquet of DAISIES.
HARRY (O.S.)
Think of it this way...
As Harry passes each student they look to him, eager for
approval--he nods warmly.
HARRY
...every great wizard in history
started out as nothing more than
what we are now--students. If they
could do it...why not you?
Harry turns to survey the room--STUDENTS FLOATING in the
AIR, being KNOCKED OFF THEIR FEET, FROZEN. The joy of
learning is palpable. Harry takes it all in, exhilarated.
70A-4 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 70A-4
Filch returns miserably to his stool...to find a big pink
heart-shaped CANDY BOX with elaborate bow sitting on it,
a card reading: "to Mr. Filch." Enraptured, Filch lifts
up the lid, takes out a SWEET, lifts it to his lips--
66.
70A-5 INT. UMBRIDGE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 70A-5
His face covered in BOILS, Filch again stands before
Umbridge's desk. Furious, Umbridge again SNAPS her PENCIL
in two...then, unsatisfied, grabs ANOTHER PENCIL and
snaps it as well.
70A-6 EXT. COURTYARD - DAY 70A-6
Crabbe, Goyle and Malfoy cheerfully shove a poor FIRST
YEAR back and forth between them like a football...
...as FROM HIGH ABOVE we reveal UMBRIDGE, again watching.
She has an idea. Once again she turns, WHISPERS into
Filch's ear, as again his dimness hardens into
understanding, then determination...

handsome silver "I" PIN on their lapels. Umbridge pins
the last one on a smirking Draco. OFF Umbridge, demonic
in the candlelight--
74A-1 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT 74A-1
Harry suddenly JOLTS awake from a nightmare--as if caused
by the previous shot of Umbridge.
74A INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - DAY 74A
The DEATH EATER DUMMY once again grins at us. SPIRAL DOWN
FROM ABOVE TO REVEAL the class standing in a large CIRCLE
around it. Their skills clearly improved, the students
brandish their wands, happily sending it spinning back
and forth between them. As cries of STUPEFY send it
flying, LEVICORPUS sends it floating, EXPELLIARMUS
disarms it, it ricochets faster and faster--yet there is
a grace and balletic quality to the coordinated attacks...

Luna hurries down the corridor, ducks through the new
location of the FILIGREED DOOR. REVEAL Draco, who's
staked out that particular wall--
75A INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - DAY - INTERCUT 75A

HARRY walks the perimeter of the circle. Trying to show
professorial restraint, he's obviously elated...

Draco signals excitedly to Filch, who motions to Crabbe,
Goyle and Warrington at other corners...
Filch signals NOW. They rush to the door--

an orgy of furious destruction. Finally she SWEEPS the
contents of her desk off with her arm--which rains down
on Filch, cowering in the corner--
NEVILLE (O.S.)
Expelliarmus!
76 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - EARLY EVENING 76
A WAND flies from PARVATI's hand, clatters to the floor.
The STUDENTS surrounding the two duelers stare in silent
disbelief--as does Neville, who looks up at Harry.
68.
NEVILLE
I--I did it.
Harry beams at his friend with pride as EVERYONE comes
up to congratulate Neville, pound his back...
CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS glint in the blue magic-hour light.
Harry turns to catch the eye of Nigel, standing near the
door with the MARAUDER'S MAP. He gives Harry a thumbs up.
HARRY
(blows his WHISTLE)
All right, that's it for this time.
Now we won't be meeting again
until after the holiday...
(a disappointed GROAN)
...so keep working on your own as
best you can. But good work,
everyone--really.
A spontaneous round of APPLAUSE as Harry turns pink;
Hermione and Ron beam.
As class breaks up STUDENTS wish Harry "Happy Christmas."
The room begins to clear as Harry collects the cushions.
He pauses as he spots Cho standing alone by the class
NOTICE BOARD. He takes a deep breath, starts toward her--
but is intercepted by Fred and George, each with an
armful of bright orange SKIVING SNACKBOXES.
FRED
We've been thinking, Harry--we
could slip Umbridge some puking
Pastilles with her tea.
GEORGE
Or Fever Fudge--they give you
these massive pus-filled boils
right on your--
HARRY
Sounds good guys...would you
excuse me?
They glance at Cho; grin. Harry flushes...then approaches
a tearful Cho.
HARRY
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other
day...
CHO
I'm okay. Anyway it's worth it...
Her gaze rises to the NOTICE BOARD; on it is the
PARCHMENT with the list of D.A. members, the PHOTO of
the old Order, Prophet articles with ominous
headlines...and a large photo of CEDRIC DIGGORY in a
69.
place of honor.
CHO
It's just...learning all this...it
makes me wonder whether if he'd
known it...
HARRY
Cedric did know this stuff. He was
really good. It's just Voldemort
was better.
CHO
You're a really good teacher,
Harry. I've never been able to
Stun anything before...
Cho looks into Harry's eyes. The moment is palpable...and
as Cho silently glances up, we SWEEP UP TO REVEAL the
MISTLETOE hanging over their heads.
CHO
Mistletoe.
HARRY
(swallows hard)
Yeah....probably full of Nargles
though.
CHO
What are Nargles?
HARRY
No idea.
And with that they both find themselves leaning in...Time
slows, the HEAVENS SPIN as they KISS--
77 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 77
Hermione and Ron are sitting eagerly opposite Harry, who
still has a stunned expression on his face.
RON
Well? How was it?
HARRY
Wet.
(clarifying)
I mean she was sort of...crying.
RON
(winces sympathetically)
That bad at it, are you?
70.
HERMIONE
I'm sure Harry's kissing was more
than satisfactory. Cho spends half
her time crying these days.
RON
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.
HERMIONE
(incredulous)
Don't you understand how she must
be feeling?
Harry and Ron share a bewildered look, shake their heads.
HERMIONE
Well obviously she's feeling sad
about Cedric, and therefore
confused about liking Harry and
guilty about kissing him. Also
she's conflicted because Umbridge
is threatening to have her Mum
sacked from her job at the Ministry,
as well as frightened of failing
her OWLs because she's so busy
worrying about everything else.
RON
One person can't feel all that at
once, they'd explode!
HERMIONE
Just because you've got the
emotional range of a teaspoon...
Harry grins as Ron makes a face at Hermione...but as
Harry looks into the FIRE his smile fades...the crackling

beside the victim, or looking down
on the scene?
Harry glances over at Ron--now joined by a subdued George,
Fred and a frightened Ginny, all in their dressing gowns.
Harry hesitates.

Neither. It was like I...I...
Dumbledore closes his eyes in pained comprehension.

Phineas: I need you to go to your
portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell
them that Arthur Weasley has been
gravely injured and that his wife
and children will be arriving
shortly by portkey.
PHINEAS nods, exits--once more Harry tries to catch
Dumbledore's eye--just as Everard returns, out of breath--
73.
EVERARD
They've got him, Albus. It was
close but they think he'll make it;
they're taking him to St. Mungo's
now.
DUMBLEDORE
(deeply relieved)
Thank heavens. Now. Next we must--
HARRY
(erupting)
LOOK AT ME!
Silence! Dumbledore's blue eyes lock onto Harry in
surprise--and fear. For an instant Harry's eyes are
ablaze with rage--though whether his own or Voldemort's
isn't immediately clear.
Harry falters; suddenly bewildered, terrified.
HARRY
What's happening to me...?
Dumbledore turns away, anguished...as SNAPE appears in
the doorway.
SNAPE
You wished to see me, Headmaster?
DUMBLEDORE
Yes, Severus. I'm afraid we daren't
wait even until morning.
80A INT. DUNGEON SPIRAL STAIR - NIGHT 80A
WE SPIRAL UP FROM ABOVE as Snape pulls Harry after him
down into the bowels of the castle...
SNAPE (O.S.)
Occlumency: the art of magical
mind defense...
80B INT. SNAPE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 80B
Harry shivers as he looks around the shadowy office,
filled with hundreds of JARS of potion ingredients.
SNAPE
It would appear there is a
connection between the Dark Lord's
mind and your own. Whether he is
yet aware of this connection is,
for the moment, unclear. Pray he
remains ignorant.
74.
HARRY
You mean if he knows...he'll be
able to read my mind?
SNAPE
Read it. Control it. Unhinge it...
In the past it was often the Dark
Lord's pleasure to invade the
minds of his victims, creating
visions designed to torture them
into madness. Only after extracting
the last exquisite ounce of agony--
only when he had them literally
begging for death--would he finally
kill them.
(approaching)
Used properly the power of
Occlumency will help shield you
from access or influence. In these
lessons I will attempt to penetrate
your mind. You will attempt to
resist. Prepare yourself.
(raising his wand)
LEGILIMENS!
Harry squeezes shut his eyes--

WHIZZING SOUND...
88G INT. BASEMENT KITCHEN - GRIMMAULD PLACE - CHRISTMAS DAY 88G
Harry steps into the doorway, takes in the scene.
The FIREBOLT soars over Ron and Hermione, through the
ENCHANTED SNOW falling over a CHRISTMAS TREE in the
corner. The kids sit among a huge pile of (animated)
wrapping paper.
75.
Mr Weasley sits by the fire. As he looks up he sees Harry
in the doorway, raises his GLASS to him in gratitude.
Harry, guilt-stricken, tries to smile back...
...and then he notices another figure standing in the
doorway opposite: Sirius, also watching from the
periphery. As Harry meets his eye Sirius smiles shyly,
like a little boy, at this kind of Christmas he never
knew. A moment between them, as we DISSOLVE TO...
89 INT. FOYER/TAPESTRY ROOM - GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY 89
Ron and Hermione lug their bags toward the front door.
As Harry follows he pauses in an open doorway--and stares.
POV: Sunlight falls across an enormous faded TAPESTRY
depicting a sprawling FAMILY TREE: The Noble and Most
Ancient House of Black, "Toujours Pur." Harry approaches...
KREACHER (O.S.)
Nasty brat, standing there bold as
brass...
Harry turns in surprise to find KREACHER, lovingly
polishing a MUTTERING curtained PORTRAIT. The old Elf's
eyes widen; he HISSES:
KREACHER
Harry Potter...the boy who stopped
the Dark Lord. Friend to mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike...if my
poor Mistress only knew...
Kreacher spits at Harry's feet--
SIRIUS (O.S.)
KREACHER!
(Kreacher whirls to find
Sirius in the doorway)
Enough of your bile. Leave us.
KREACHER
Of course, Master. Kreacher lives
to serve the Noble House of Black...
He bows out, MUTTERING all the way. Sirius grimaces.
SIRIUS
Sorry about that. He was never
very pleasant, even when I was a
boy. Well, not to me anyway...
HARRY
Wait a second--you grew up here?
76.
SIRIUS
It was my parents house. I offered
it to Dumbledore as headquarters
for the Order. About the only
useful thing I've been able to do.
He moves to the tapestry; regards it.
SIRIUS
I hated the lot of them; my parents
with their pure-blood mania...
We notice the MOVING IMAGE of a wild-eyed WITCH, her face
literally UNRAVELING--BELLATRIX LESTRANGE. Nearby, next
to REGULUS BLACK, Harry finds Sirius' name--but instead
of a portrait there is only a SCORCHED HOLE.
SIRIUS
My Mother did that after I ran
away. Charming woman. I was sixteen.
HARRY
Where did you go?
SIRIUS
Your Dad's. I was always welcome
at the Potter's... I see him so
much in you, Harry. You're so very
much alike...
HARRY
I'm not so sure.
(hesitates)
Sirius...When I saw Mr. Weasley
attacked, I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake. And afterwards,
in Dumbledore's office...for a
moment I wanted to...I wanted...
He can't say it. Anguished:
HARRY
This connection between me and
Voldemort--what if the reason for
it is because...is because I'm
becoming more like him?
(helplessly)
I just feel so angry all the time
now...What if, after everything
I've been through, something's...
(his darkest fear)
....gone wrong inside me? What if
I"m becoming...bad?
Sirius looks deeply into his Godson's eyes.
77.
SIRIUS
I want you to listen to me very
carefully, Harry. You are not a
bad person. You're a very good
person, who bad things have
happened to. Do you understand?
(Harry, welling, nods)
Besides...the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.
We've all got both light and dark
inside us. What matters is the
part we choose to act on. That's
who we really are.
Harry looks up at Sirius, deeply grateful. And then
Hermione appears in the doorway.
HERMIONE
Harry? Time to go.
Harry nods. Turns to Sirius.
HARRY
Seems like we're always saying
goodbye.
SIRIUS
It won't always be this way. When
all this is over we'll be a proper
family. You'll see.
As Sirius and Harry hug, we MOVE PAST them toward the

name--FLY THROUGH IT--

Far below, STUDENTS linger in the COURTYARD. FIND one of
them--Ron--urgently pushing his way through--
91 EXT. COURTYARD - SAME TIME - DAY 91
Ron races through the throng until he reaches Hermione,
her nose deep in a book. As he whispers in her ear she
lights up. Now both hurry through the crowd--past Draco
Malfoy, a familiar arm around an uncertain Seamus--to
find Harry, talking shyly to Cho, perhaps asking her out
on a date. Hermione whispers to Harry--he looks at her
in surprise--
78.
92 EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - DAY 92
The trio races down the slope; PAN with them as they
approach Hagrid's hut, its windows finally lit.
They slow at the sound of raised VOICES within. Harry
motions them around the side--they peer in the window...
93 INT. HAGRID'S HUT - DAY - CONTINUOUS 93
Umbridge paces before HAGRID, his back to us.
UMBRIDGE
...I will say this one last time.
As High Inquisitor and the
Ministry's representative I am
ordering you to tell me where
you've been!
HAGRID
I told yer--I've been away for me
health.
As he speaks he turns toward the window--revealing his
horribly bruised face. Hermione GASPS. Hagrid gives her
a warning look. Umbridge leans to look around his massive
form but the trio has ducked out of sight--just.
UMBRIDGE
Your health.
HAGRID
Bit o' fresh air, yeh know.
UMBRIDGE
Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must
be difficult to come by.
(pausing)
You should know "Professor," the
Ministry is most determined to
weed out unsatisfactory teachers--
particularly those less...lucky...in
their lineage. You are half giant,
are you not?
Hagrid stiffens. Hermione stares, her blood boiling. Ron
warns her with a stern but sympathetic look.
HAGRID
I don't see what that has to do
with my ability to teach.
UMBRIDGE
No...You wouldn't.
(pausing at the door)
If I were you I shouldn't get too
used to being back. In fact...I
mightn't bother unpacking at all.
79.
LATER. The FIRE CRACKLES as Hagrid places a kettle over it.
HERMIONE
Oh Hagrid, what happened?
HAGRID
I told yer, it's nothin'. Want a
cuppa?
RON
Nothing? Would you say that if one
of us turned up with a pound of
mince instead of a face?
Hagrid grimaces, limps over to his chair, winces as he
clutches his ribs. As he settles back in his chair he
slaps a green dragon steak over his eye...which his tail-
wagging BOARHOUND FANG locks his eyes on.
HARRY
Hagrid...it's us.
Hagrid hesitates--looks around warily--then leans in, low:
HAGRID
Now this is all top secret, mind
yeh...but Dumbledore sent me ter
parley with the Giants.
HERMIONE
Giants!
(Hagrid shushes her
nervously; whispers:)
You found them?
HAGRID
They're not that difficult ter
find, ter be honest. Pretty big,
see. Live deep in the mountains...
Went over a ridge one nigh' an'
there they was...Like watchin'
bits o' the mountain movin'...
HARRY
And they did this to you?
HAGRID
(hesitates)
Not exactly...I mean, in a manner
o' speakin'...
(finally sighs)
Long story.
The trio exchange confused looks...
HAGRID
Anyhow I tried to convince 'em ter
join the cause--but I wasn't the
only one trying to win 'em over...
80.
RON
Death Eaters?
HAGRID
(nods; grimly:)
Tryin' to persuade 'em to join
You-Know-Who.

And...? Did they?
HAGRID
Don' know. I gave 'em Dumbledore's
message; I 'spect some o' them'll
remember he's friendly to 'em...I
'spect. Oh all right yeh can have
it, yeh dozy dog...
Fang, who has been WHIMPERING plaintively, now leaps up
as Hagrid tosses him the steak, attacks it with relish.
Hagrid rises, goes to the window. Subdued:
HAGRID
It's changin' out there. Jus' like

The storm's comin', Harry. And we
all best be ready when she does.

We are racing over white-capped waves; TILT UP to reveal
the brooding island fortress of AZKABAN, the surrounding
skies circled by patrolling DEMENTORS. UNEARTHLY DARK
CLOUDS BEGIN TO SWIRL, forming a miniature HURRICANE
above the prison.
As we approach the towering walls suddenly SNAKELIKE
BOLTS OF LIGHTNING angle in from the roiling skies--
blowing out a huge section of wall--
81.
97A INT. AZKABAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DUSK 97A
--as a series of DARK FIGURES huddled in the corners of
still darker CELLS are suddenly blinded by storm-light:
DOLOHOV--a pale, twisted face with murderous eyes. He
looks sharply down at the the DARK MARK that swims on
his bare, heavily-muscled forearm--then slowly back up
as his hard face grows still harder--
ROOKWOOD--pockmarked, wind blowing his greasy hair, eyes
dead as a shark's--smiles a snaggle-toothed smile.
A familiar gaunt-faced WOMAN with straggly hair and a
cruel mouth looks up. Lovingly fingers her own DARK MARK
as she whispers ecstatically:
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE
My Lord.
BELLATRIX stands, staggers toward the blown-out wall in
her cell, high above the cliffs. She laughs a terrifying
laugh, as RAIN lashes her and the SEA CRASHES on the
rocks below.
MORE DEMENTORS SCREAM OUT TOWARD US. As the ALARMS SHRIEK
they HOWL straight for us--suddenly we PULL BACK with
dizzying speed--
--and the image becomes a PHOTO on the front page of the
Daily Prophet. A HEADLINE screams: MASS BREAKOUT FROM
AZKABAN. Again we DESCEND back into the paper...
FUDGE (O.S.)
We have confirmed that ten high-
security prisoners escaped in the
early hours of yesterday evening;
the Muggle Prime Minister has been
alerted to the danger...
WHOOSH--the PAGE TURNS to reveal a MOVING PHOTO of
FUDGE--fear in his eyes--now retreating through the
Atrium as he dodges a throng of REPORTERS.
FUDGE
We strongly suspect this breakout
was engineered by a man with
personal experience escaping
Azkaban: notorious mass-murderer
Sirius Black, cousin to escapee
Bellatrix Lestrange...
We rapidly PULL OUT--
98 INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING 98

He looks up, his gaze hard, distant. FIND the trio just

beyond--Harry looking at Neville with a frown. Beyond we
see other subdued students, also reading the Prophet...
HERMIONE
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could
happen. He's going to get us all
killed, just because he's too
scared to face the truth.
SEAMUS (O.S.)
Harry?
Harry turns in surprise to find a nervous Seamus.
SEAMUS
I wanted to apologize. Now even me
Mam says the Prophet's version of
things don't add up. What I'm
trying to say is...I believe you.
98A INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - DAY 98A
As Harry enters the empty room before class he sees a
lone figure standing at the class notice board.
Harry silently joins Neville, who is looking up at the
PHOTO of the old Order. Neville studies his parents'
smiling faces; then, softly:
NEVILLE
Fourteen years ago...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange used the
Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She
tortured them for information, but
they never gave in. They've
been...like you saw...ever since.
Harry doesn't know what to say. Neville turns to him.
NEVILLE
I'm quite proud to be their son.
But I'm not sure I'm ready for
everyone to know just yet.
Harry nods...then puts a hand on Neville's shoulder.
HARRY
We're going to make them proud,
Neville. That's a promise.
They both look up at the photo...both sets of parents
smiling down at their sons.
99 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - SAME DAY - LATER 99
Harry walks among the students. The mood is serious,
focused; Harry's command firm and authoritative.
83.
HARRY
Make it a powerful memory, the
happiest you can remember. Allow
it to fill you up...
He passes the newest DA Member--SEAMUS--straining as a
WISP OF VAPOR comes out of his wand...
HARRY
Keep trying, Seamus...
(moving on)
A corporeal Patronus is the most
difficult to produce, but shield
forms can also be extremely useful
against a variety of opponents...
He passes Hermione, rigid with concentration. Suddenly
an OTTER PATRONUS BLOOMS from her wand, gambols around
her, to her delight. Harry nods his approval.
HARRY
Now remember: Your Patronus can
only protect you as long as you
stay focused...
He passes Luna, peering vaguely down the end of her wand.
HARRY
Focus, Luna.
Luna sighs as Harry moves on...passes Neville, his face
shining with sweat. But only feeble wisps of vapor issue
from his wand tip.
HARRY
Think of the happiest thing you
can, Neville.
NEVILLE
(holding his breath)
I'm--trying--
Finally he exhales. Determined, instantly tries again--
Harry approaches Ginny, straining-- suddenly LIGHT erupts
out of her wand; she stares in amazement at the SILVERY
VEIL above her.
Harry smiles with pride as he turns to take in the class,
mostly VAPOR and SHIELDS--but here and there an animal
form--a BADGER erupts from Somewhat Doubtful Boy's
wand...a DOG forms in front of an amazed Ron--
NIGEL
Harry!
Nigel urgently motions Harry to join him by the door.
84.
HARRY
Who've we got this time?
NIGEL
All of them I think.
INSERT: On the MARAUDER'S MAP we see the names UMBRIDGE,
FILCH, MALFOY--and a DOZEN OTHERS--floating just on the
other side of the wall. Harry frowns.
HARRY
That's funny. How would they know
we're here now...?
He turns to see Cho's usual spot is empty.
Suddenly a BOOMING THUD makes the entire door wall
vibrate. DUST trickles down from above.
Shields begin to EVAPORATE as the class looks over in
confusion. Another THUD; more DUST falls as the stones
GROAN in protest.
THUD--MORTAR flies--Harry throws himself in front of
Nigel as a thin beam of LIGHT stabs the dusty air. Harry
cautiously peers through the chink...to see Filch,
sledgehammer in hand; Umbridge beside him.
UMBRIDGE
Stand aside, Argus. I'll make
short work of this.
She AIMS HER WAND directly at us. Harry's eyes go wide--
HARRY
GET DOWN!
UMBRIDGE
BOMBARDA MAXIMA!
A GLITTERING EXPLOSION rocks the room as students dive
for cover. Choking on dust, Harry pulls himself to his
feet...to see a huge, ragged HOLE has taken out half the
wall, its raw edges sparkling with residual MAGICAL
ENERGY. The ROOM ITSELF seems to GROAN IN PAIN as shadows
appear through colored smoke--
HARRY
RUN!
UMBRIDGE

100 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT CORRIDOR - DAY 100
We MOVE through the chaos as students spill out through
the hole in a panic--right into the waiting clutches of
the Inquisitorial Squad. Harry watches it all helplessly...
85.
...then sees through the madness the still figure of
Umbridge, her triumphant eyes locked on Harry.
101 INT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY 101
Umbridge brandishes a familiar piece of PARCHMENT:
UMBRIDGE (O.S.)
Dumbledore's Army--proof of what
I've been telling you right from
the beginning, Cornelius!
Fudge, Shacklebolt, and DAWLISH--a tough-looking wizard
with short wiry hair--surround Dumbledore. Percy Weasley
takes notes.
Harry stares at Cho, seated, near tears. Cho looks up at
him pleadingly...but finally Harry is unable to look at
her, and turns away. Cho wells up...
Umbridge hands the DA Parchment to a stunned Fudge as
she sneers at Dumbledore:
UMBRIDGE
All your fearmongering about You-
Know-Who never fooled us for a
minute. We saw your lies for what
they were--a smokescreen for your
bid to seize control of the
Ministry!
DUMBLEDORE
Naturally.
Harry's eyes widen as he realizes what Dumbledore's doing.
HARRY
Professor--no--!
(desperately turns to
Umbridge)
He knew nothing about this! It was
me--!
DUMBLEDORE
(overriding him)
Most noble of you, Harry, to try
and shield me, but as has been
pointed out, the Parchment clearly
says "Dumbledore's Army"--not
"Potter's."
(turns to Fudge)
I instructed Harry to form this
organization--and I alone am
responsible for its activities.
Fudge blinks at Dumbledore, slightly stunned...as
Dumbledore looks reassuringly at Harry.
86.
FUDGE
Dispatch an owl to the Daily
Prophet; if we hurry we should
still make the morning edition.
Dawlish, Shacklebolt: You will
escort Dumbledore to Azkaban to
await trial for conspiracy and
sedition--
DUMBLEDORE
Ah, I thought we might hit that
little snag. You seem to be
laboring under the delusion that I
am going to--what is the phrase?
'Come quietly.' But I'm afraid I
have no intention of going to
Azkaban.
UMBRIDGE
Enough of this rubbish. TAKE HIM.
As they raise their wands Dumbledore smiles a warm,
encouraging smile at Harry--who looks helplessly back--
And then a STREAK OF SILVER LIGHT flashes as FAWKES
swoops low overhead. Harry watches in astonishment as
Dumbledore WHIRLS--A CONCUSSIVE BLAST OF LIGHT sends
Fudge and Umbridge sprawling as Dumbledore reaches up to
grab the Phoenix' tail--and in a BLAZE OF FIRE both bird
and Headmaster are gone. As Fudge and Umbridge sit up,
stunned, Shacklebolt smiles a private smile.
SHACKLEBOLT
You may not like him, Minister...
but you can't deny Dumbledore's
got style.
102 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NOTICE AREA - DAY 102
CLANG. Educational Decree No. 119: Dolores Jane Umbridge

he sets it on its side the OCCUPANTS of the GROUP

PORTRAIT tumble into a pile.
We continue on, FLYING into the Great Hall, where the
remains of Dumbledore's Army sit silently at a table. At
first we think a test is in progress...until we notice
the familiar BLACK QUILLS they are writing with...and
their expressions of pain...and the redness of the ink.
LAND finally on Umbridge, in headmistress robes, alone
at the high table. Regal.

As Harry comes out a sniffle causes him to turn...to see
a FIGURE lurking in the shadow of the statue. Cho. Her
eyes pleading, desperate to explain.
CHO
Harry...
Harry hesitates...then finally turns away, unable to look
at her. As he walks away Cho stares after him, tears
welling...then turns and runs.

A chilly DRIZZLE falls over the valley as we find the
small figures of the trio, standing at the bridge's
railing. They look silently out over the sea of shifting
MIST. Harry is distraught.
RON
...you did everything you could.
No one could win against that old
hag.
HERMIONE
He's right. Not even Dumbledore
saw this coming. Besides, if it's
anyone's fault it's ours...
RON
Yeah, we talked you into it.
88.
HARRY
But I agreed.
(struggling)
I tried so hard to help--but all
I've done is make things worse.
(quietly)
Anyway. It doesn't matter now...
Ron and Hermione look at him, confused...then, intensely:
HARRY
...because I don't want to play
anymore. All it does is make you
care too much. And the more you
care...the more you have to lose.
(his darkest moment)
Maybe it is better just to...
HERMIONE
What?
HARRY
Go it alone.
Ron and Hermione share a worried look as Harry turns away,
starts down the bridge--but is stopped by the sight of
Hagrid peering in from the forest end of the bridge--his
face scratched and bruised; his eyes red from crying.

peering nervously around them at a wild, primeval part
of the forest.
RON
Any idea where he's taking us?
Hermione shakes her head. Harry approaches Hagrid.
HARRY
Hagrid? Please, can't you just
tell us--
Hagrid tries to reply, but--too upset to speak--finally
just shakes his head woefully and continues on. Ron looks
after him with quiet awe:
RON
He's lost his mind.
89.
LATER. We are now surrounded by giant primordial trees
with enormous EXPOSED ROOTS. Suddenly Hagrid stops,
listening... and then we hear it: an ominous RUMBLING--
growing closer.
HERMIONE
What is that?
RON
Whatever it is...it's not a happy
sound.
Suddenly Hagrid scoops up all three of them, DIVES off
the path--just as a deafening BLUR OF HOOVES THUNDER BY.
As the trio peers up through the roots we catch glimpses
of HUMAN TORSOS and fierce, war-painted faces.
As the herd of CENTAURS finally passes Hagrid and the
trio rise, look after them.
HAGRID
Never seen the Centaurs so riled--
an' they're dangerous at the bes'
of times. Ministry restricts their
territory much more, they're gonna
have a real uprisin' on their
hands--or worse.
HERMIONE
(gently)
Hagrid...? What's going on?
Hagrid takes out his huge spotted handkerchief, blows
his nose, wipes his tear-filled eyes.
HAGRID
Sorry t'be so mysterious you three.

this at all--but with Dumbledore

sack any day now, an' I can' leave

As the group approaches a clearing Hagrid motions them
to slow, whispers.

They creep forward, emerge into a clearing with a small
HILL in the center. A low, rhythmic RUMBLING is audible.

As the "hill" shifts in its sleep several BIRDS light
into the air. Hagrid cautiously approaches the slumbering
GIANT.

Oh Hagrid...you didn't.
HAGRID
I had ter bring 'im back! The
other giants were all bullyin' him,
'cause he's so small!
HERMIONE
Small?
(and once more)
Small?
HAGRID
I couldn' jus' leave 'im! See--
he's my brother.
RON
Blimey.
HAGRID
Well--half-brother. Turns out
after me mother left me dad she
took up with this other giant,
see--well actually, she knew him
before she left, but it wasn't
'til after that she went an had--
(sighs)
Long story.
GRAWP STIRS, sniffing at Hagrid...cautiously opens a
sleepy eye.
HAGRID
Had a nice sleep, did yeh Grawpy?
Grawp YAWNS hugely, stretches, and rises to his full
sixteen-foot height. He peers in fascination at the
circling BIRDS...
HAGRID
Grawp! Down here, yeh big buffoon!
Ignoring him, Grawp playfully reaches for one of the
BIRDS--catches it--SPLAT. He frowns in confusion...tears
well...and then abruptly licks his hand. BELCHES.
HAGRID
Come on now Grawpy! I brought yeh
some company!
91.
Finally Grawp peers curiously down at the trio; as he
starts toward them he absently KNOCKS Hagrid out of the
way--OOF. The trio step back in alarm--but Grawp is
stopped short by a ROPE tying him to a nearby tree.
HARRY
Hagrid...is this how you got all
your injuries?
As Hagrid climbs to his feet he flushes, embarrassed:
HAGRID
Oh, no no no no...well, yes. But
he's a good boy, really--jes don'
know his own strength is all....
Grawp bends down; Harry and Ron don't much interest him,
but Hermione is another matter. He sniffs...smiles a shy
broken-toothed smile...and with a swift movement grabs
her and lifts her into the air. Hermione SCREAMS.
HAGRID
GRAWPY! THA'S NOT POLITE!
Hermione is rigid as Grawp deeply breathes in her hair,
sighs happily.
RON
HAGRID, DO SOMETHING!
HAGRID
(sternly, clears his
throat)
BAD BOY, GRAWPY! I tol' yeh, we
don' grab--! Tha's yer new friend
Hermione!
Ron finds a stick and starts furiously beating Grawp's
shins as Hagrid desperately tries to save the situation.
HAGRID
Don' you worry now, he's completely
harmless--! PUT HER DOWN YEH BIG
OAF! Like I said, jes a bit high-
spirited is all--GRAWPY--!
Suddenly Grawp kicks Ron, sending him sprawling into a
tree--hard. Ron winces in pain. Hagrid grimaces. Hermione
turns instantly to Grawp, fixes him a furious stare.
HERMIONE
Grawp. GRAWP. Listen. Carefully:
Put. Me. DOWN.
(Grawp hesitates)
NOW.
Her tone defies the possibility of argument.
92.
Grawp frowns...then reluctantly complies. Ron is there
in an instant as Hermione brushes off her jumper.
RON
Are you all right?
HERMIONE
Just needs a firm hand is all.
HARRY
I think you've got an admirer...
Grawp is biting his finger, gazing down at Hermione with
inordinate fondness. Ron glares jealously up at him.
RON
You just stay away from her.
Chastened, Grawp turns to where he's stored a collection
of precious items under a tree root. He picks out a
bicycle handlebar with a bell, shyly presents it to
Hermione, who blushes.
HAGRID
He can get his own food an' all...
it's company he'll need--after I'm
gone.
(to Harry)
Yeh will look after him, won't yer?
I'm the only family he's got.
Harry looks helplessly up at Grawp...and nods.
A BIRD CRIES; wheels through the dusky, star-strewn sky.
Grawp looks up, follows it wistfully with his eyes, as
if envying its freedom...DISSOLVE TO:
107A INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 107A
We are FLOATING THROUGH an EMPTY CLASSROOM. Bands of
DAZZLING LIGHT from the windows alternate with DEEP
SHADOW. We APPROACH a familiar SMALL FIGURE standing
before the MIRROR OF ERISED...ELEVEN-YEAR OLD HARRY gazes
longingly up at the reflection of JAMES and LILY POTTER...
...and then a sneering figure steps out between them:
SNAPE
Feeling sentimental...?
Suddenly the IMAGE SWIMS, RUSHES TOWARD US--WHOOSH--

109 INT. SNAPE'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 109
Harry's eyes fly open. Snape stands opposite, wand
raised--they are in the middle of an Occlumency lesson.
Through gritted teeth:
HARRY
That's--private.
SNAPE
Not to me--and not to the Dark
Lord if you don't improve! Every
memory he has access to is a
weapon he can use against you! You
won't last two seconds once he
invades your mind!
(sneers)
You're just like your father. Lazy.
Arrogant.
HARRY

SNAPE
Weak.
HARRY
I'm. Not. Weak.
SNAPE
Then prove it. Control your
emotions, discipline your mind!
Legilimens--!
A FLASH OF RED--again the OFFICE SWIMS--
109A FLASH CUTS 109A
A FLURRY of blurred IMAGES RUSH TOWARD US as we're
PLUNGED through HARRY'S MIND--Harry under the sorting
hat--Harry and Cedric running through the Maze...
SNAPE (O.S.)
Concentrate, Potter. FOCUS--
The IMAGE SWIMS, FALLS AWAY--we're SPUN UP THROUGH
ANOTHER FLURRY OF IMAGES, which suddenly RESOLVES into--

Younger Harry smiles...as we CIRCLE to reveal SNAPE.
SNAPE
I may vomit.
109C INT. SNAPE'S OFFICE - NIGHT - SCENE CONTINUES 109C
Again Harry opens his eyes, seething.
HARRY
STOP IT--!
SNAPE
Is this what you call control?
Harry stares--and falters. He looks exhausted.
HARRY
We've been at it for hours. If I
could just rest--
SNAPE
The Dark Lord isn't resting!
(approaching)
You and Black are two of a kind:
sentimental children forever
whining about how bitterly unfair
your lives have been. Well perhaps
it's escaped your notice but life
isn't fair. Your "blessed" father
knew that, in fact he frequently
saw to it--
HARRY
My father was a great man!
SNAPE
YOUR FATHER WAS A SWINE--
Snape PUSHES Harry's chest, sending him crashing into a
wall of jars. Fury burns in Harry's eyes. He raises his
wand--Snape extends his own--
SNAPE
LEGILIMENS!
HARRY
PROTEGO!
The brilliant FLASH OF RED from Snape's wand recoils off
Harry, sends Snape sprawling in surprise--we hurtle into

111A SERIES OF SHOTS - SNAPE'S MEMORY 111A
FIFTEEN YEAR-OLD SNAPE sits hugging his knees in the
corner of a shabby room; the sound of his PARENTS
FIGHTING off. In a flash the image DISSOLVES, FLIES PAST
US--only YOUNG SNAPE staying constant, but now he is
111B INT. HOGWARTS CORRIDOR - SNAPE'S MEMORY - DAY 111B
hugging his schoolbooks to his chest as he hurries past
a trio of older PRETTY GIRLS, laughing at him--he looks

shoe. The IMAGE SPINS AROUND US as we PLUNGE through it--
112 EXT. HOGWARTS LAWN - SNAPE'S MEMORY - DAY 112
FIFTEEN YEAR-OLD JAMES POTTER sneers directly at us--
YOUNG JAMES
HEY SNIVELLUS!
Young Snape, sitting alone under a tree, looks up from
his book with panicked eyes. Immediately pulls his wand
from his robe--
YOUNG JAMES
Expelliarmus!
Young Snape's wand flies out of his reach. As he dives
to retrieve it--
YOUNG JAMES
Impedimenta!
Snape goes sprawling--and FREEZES IN MID-AIR...as now we
REVEAL HARRY, watching in mute horror.
HARRY
Dad...?
Suddenly the memory SWIMS, JUMP CUTS--Harry remains
constant but the scene shifts around him to moments
later--a CROWD has gathered. YOUNG SIRIUS, YOUNG LUPIN,
and YOUNG WORMTAIL back up James as he effortlessly
rotates Young Snape in the air. Young Sirius exchanges
an uneasy look with Young Lupin, as a pretty GIRL with
red hair pushes through the crowd.
YOUNG LILY
Leave him alone!
96.
YOUNG JAMES
Well well, the indomitable Miss
Evans...
HARRY
Mum...
YOUNG LILY
Why do you hate him so much, Potter?
YOUNG SNAPE
(humiliated)
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP, MUDBLOOD--
Lily reacts as if slapped--she and Young Snape lock eyes.
James angrily brandishes his wand--SCOURGIFY!--and SOAP
BUBBLES froth from Snape's mouth, gagging him.
YOUNG JAMES
He makes it easy to hate him...
doesn't he.
A shaken Lily looks up at James.
YOUNG LILY
That's the thing, isn't it. Hate
is always easy. It's the other bit
that's hard. But you wouldn't
understand that--would you.
James' assurance falters. He watches her vanish into the
crowd...then turns to the crowd with false cheer:
YOUNG JAMES
Who wants to see me take off
Snivelly's pants?
SNAPE
ENOUGH--!!!
Harry looks up to see adult Snape, white with rage--THE
SCENE DISSOLVES BEHIND HIM--
113 INT. SNAPE'S OFFICE - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 113
--as WITHOUT A CUT we are back in Snape's office--Snape
grabs Harry by the throat.
SNAPE
Your lessons are at an end.
HARRY

SNAPE
Get. Out.
Terrified, Harry bolts--
97.
113A EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT 113A
Harry bursts out the front doors, breathless. Races
blindly away from the castle, churning with emotion.
Finally he comes to rest by a far pillar, grief-stricken,
shell-shocked...we HOLD on Harry...
And then after a moment he hears an unexpected sound...a
young BOY CRYING. Perplexed, Harry follows the sound...to
find a young FIRST YEAR [as in the opening playground
scene, there is a subtle echo of a young Harry] sitting
alone against a wall, nursing the back of his hand--
obviously the recent victim of an Umbridge detention.
Harry looks at the crying boy, helpless...despairing...is
this just the way the world really is?
And then his eyes are drawn toward a silhouetted figure
standing in the great doorway: Umbridge, in her
headmistress robes, her face a study in cold triumph. As
Harry stares back at her, helpless, Umbridge smiles...
...and as we begin to CRANE UP to a high POV we PAN to
take in two more figures, watching it all from high above:
Fred and George. Their faces grimly determined...
FRED
(quietly)
You know George...I've always felt
our futures lay outside the world
of academic achievement.
GEORGE
Fred: I've been thinking the same
thing myself.

118 INT. GREAT HALL - DUSK 118
The four house tables have been replaced by a hundred
smaller ones. The hall is eerily silent except for the
SCRATCHING of a hundred QUILLS: the OWLs are in progress.
Umbridge paces malevolently before the high table.
Surveys the students with an eagle eye...
TRACK down the aisle to Hermione, hurrying through the
questions--she pauses to cast a meaningful glance behind
her at Ron, chewing his pencil...who glances behind him
at Harry, clearly preoccupied...holding his breath...
BOOM.
Umbridge stops cold. STUDENTS look up in confusion.
BOOM.
The sound is coming from outside the hall. Furious at
the interruption, Umbridge strides down the aisle--
--yanks open the great doors--
--to reveal AN EIGHTY-FOOT CHINESE DRAGON roaring
straight towards her. As its giant maw opens wide
Umbridge freezes in terror--it SWALLOWS HER WHOLE--
--then EXPLODES into the GREEN AND GOLD SPARKS of an
ENCHANTED FIREWORK. As the smoke clears we see Umbridge:
choking, hair wild, frock smoking. Her eyes slowly look
up, narrow as she HISSES:
UMBRIDGE
Weasleys...
Fred and George appear high above the chaos on their
broomsticks, wave cheerily at Umbridge. SILVER ROCKETS
RICOCHET off the walls, the wind from them WHIPPING up
test papers from the desks into a miniature tornado,
sending them soaring up into the rafters...
A barrage of shocking-pink CATHERINE WHEELS whiz toward
Umbridge; she ducks just in time as they soar out the
window. She spins around in outrage, sputters:
UMBRIDGE
FILCH!!
Fred and George taunt Filch as he tries swatting at them
with his broom--which promptly bursts into flames.
FRED
So long! We won't be seeing you!
99.
GEORGE
Don't bother to keep in touch, you
old bat!
As the TWINS soar out the doors Umbridge follows them
out--
118A INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NOTICE AREA - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 118A
As Fred and George wheel above the CHEERING CROWD they
point their wands at the PROCLAMATION WALL, loosing a
JET OF FIRE across it. The Proclamations go up in flames,
drift through the air like charred confetti--as the crowd
ROARS its APPROVAL.
Harry grins hugely. As the PANDEMONIUM continues Umbridge
and Filch stand furious, impotent. The giant front doors
swing wide. The mass of students follow them as the twins
fly out, to a CRESCENDO of CHEERS--
REVERSE
The trio, surrounded by cheering students, watches from
the doorway as the twins dwindle into a glorious pink
and gold sunset.
And then Harry's grin slowly fades to confusion.
Something's wrong.
SOUND begins to die. As we PUSH IN on the trio we see
the blood draining from Harry's face. Something's very
wrong. He suddenly FLINCHES with the pain of a thousand
volts--ZZZP--

121 INT. HALL OF PROPHECY - HARRY'S VISION 121
--and circle out from behind a towering BLACK-ROBED
figure. We are surrounded by shelves of HUMMING GLASS
SPHERES. A voice cold as death speaks low:
VOLDEMORT (O.S.)
I cannot touch it...but you can.
VOLDEMORT steps aside to reveal a huddled FIGURE on the
floor. Sirius lifts his head, his face twisted in pain.
SIRIUS
You'll have to kill me.
VOLDEMORT
Oh I will. But first you will
fetch it for me. CRUCIO!
Sirius writhes in agony. As he contorts we suddenly
GLIMPSE in the distance a familiar PLAIN BLACK DOOR--our
view ROCKETS towards it at the speed of thought--and
suddenly WITHOUT A CUT we pull back from the OTHER side
of the door to reveal

small group gathering around him, lying on the floor.
Many of the other students are still celebrating,
oblivious; the last of the fireworks still going off...
123 INT. MARBLE STAIR - DUSK 123
SWEEP toward the trio, racing up the swiveling staircase
as it swings toward us. Ron and Hermione hurry after
Harry, wild with panic.
HERMIONE
Harry, are you sure?
HARRY
I saw it--just like with Mr.
Weasley! It's the same door I've
been dreaming about for months--
only I couldn't remember where I'd
seen it before!
(they don't understand)
Sirius said Voldemort was after
something--something he didn't

HARRY (CONT'D)
have last time--and it's in the
Department of Mysteries!
HERMIONE
Harry, please, just listen. What
if Voldemort meant for you to see
this? What if he's only hurting
Sirius because he's trying to get
to you?
HARRY
What if he is? I'm supposed to
just let him die?!
(desperately)
Hermione--he's the only family
I've got left.
Hermione is truly torn. She turns to find Ron looking at
her--and the loyalty and resolve in his eyes says it all.
Hermione takes a deep breath--and nods. Ron turns to Harry.
RON
What do we do.
123A EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - SUNSET 123A
The HUGE ORANGE SUN is beginning to set behind the
castle...
HARRY (V.O.)

VOICES audible beyond. As the DOOR MAGICALLY OPENS we
glimpse Ginny and Luna standing guard just outside it--
STUDENTS beyond are rushing down the stairs; in the
distance we can still hear a few FIREWORKS going off.
As the door CLOSES itself suddenly the trio--now changed
out of their robes--emerges from under the INVISIBILITY
CLOAK. They hurry toward Umbridge's office--
HARRY (O.S.)
Alohomora--!
102.
126 INT. UMBRIDGE'S OFFICE - DUSK 126
The door bursts open. As the trio hurries past a KITTEN
PLATE, the KITTEN narrows its eyes...then exits the plate.
Harry hurries to the fireplace, grabs a handful of FLOO
POWDER and tosses it into the grate. EMERALD FLAMES leap
high as he prepares to step into the fire.
HARRY
Alert the Order if you can--
RON
Are you mental? We're going with
you!
HARRY
It's too dangerous--!
HERMIONE
When are you going to get it
through your head, Harry--we're in
this together!
UMBRIDGE (O.S.)
That--you--are.
The trio spins to find a wildly disheveled Umbridge, a
mad gleam in her eye--wand extended.
ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
Harry is bound to a chair. Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Luna
are each held by a member of the Inquisitorial Squad.
Umbridge's rage is at a fever pitch.
UMBRIDGE
Take their wands.
Crabbe, Goyle and Warrington roughly comply, as Malfoy
brings in Neville, a wand at his back.
DRACO MALFOY
Caught this one trying to help the
Weasley girl.
Ginny kicks Malfoy in the shins; he HOWLS--and stumbles
into a pile of items confiscated from the Room of
Requirement. Ron's eyes fall on a stack of familiar
bright ORANGE BOXES...as Umbridge turns on Harry.
UMBRIDGE
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you.
HARRY
No--

UMBRIDGE

LIAR!
SNAPE (O.S.)
You sent for me, Headmistress?
UMBRIDGE
Snape. Yes. The time has come for

them to me or not. Have you brought
the Veritaserum?
SNAPE
I'm afraid you've used up all my
stores interrogating students; the
last of it on Miss Chang...
(the trio reacts)
Unless you wish to poison him--and
I assure you I would have the
greatest sympathy if you did--I
cannot help you. If that will be
all...
Harry watches as he turns to go; blurts out desperately.
HARRY
He's got Padfoot! He's got Padfoot
at the place where it's hidden!
Snape stops...slowly turns.
UMBRIDGE
Padfoot? What is "Padfoot?" Where
what is hidden? What is he talking
about, Snape?
Snape pauses for an excruciatingly long moment, then:
SNAPE
No idea.
And he is gone. Umbridge pauses....then slowly turns back
to Harry. Automatically straightens the wands laid out
on her desk...
UMBRIDGE
Very well. You give me no choice,
Potter. As this is an issue of
Ministry security, you leave me
with no alternative...
(taking our her wand)
The Cruciatus Curse ought to
loosen your tongue...
HERMIONE

That's illegal!

Umbridge picks up the framed PHOTO of Fudge, regards it
solemnly...then resolutely turns it face down on the desk.
UMBRIDGE
What Cornelius doesn't know won't
hurt him. After all, he never knew
I ordered the attack on Potter
last summer.
HARRY
You sent the Dementors?!
UMBRIDGE
Somebody had to act! All that
useless deliberating about what
should be done, or whether this or
the other were true--but I was the
one who actually did something!
Only you wriggled out of that one,
didn't you, Potter? Not today
though...not now...

Umbridge, her wand at Harry and Hermione's backs, looks

HERMIONE
Not far. It had to be somewhere
students weren't going to find it
accidentally.

OWLS HOOT; RUSTLINGS from the shadows. Umbridge FLINCHES
at every sound, growing more paranoid by the minute.
BRAMBLES pull at her frock, dirt falling on her shoulders,
which she compulsively brushes off...
Harry leans in to Hermione, whispers:
HARRY
What are you doing?
HERMIONE
Improvising.
129 EXT. CLEARING - DUSK 129
As the three enter Grawp's clearing Hermione stops,
stares: he's nowhere to be seen. The ROPES that bound
him lie frayed and broken.
UMBRIDGE
Well? Where is this weapon?
Hermione looks helplessly at Harry.
UMBRIDGE
(realizing)
There isn't one...is there. You
were trying to trick me.
Umbridge pauses--Harry and Hermione brace for the
explosion--then, her voice quivering:
UMBRIDGE
You know...I really hate children.
You really are the most...
(searches for the darkest
imaginable epithet)
...untidy creatures. Lord knows
I've tried to help you...to instill
discipline, and respect for decorum.
I've tried my very best to bring
order, yet at every turn been
assailed by chaos...
She now seems on the brink of a nervous breakdown. She
regards her ruined frock, her flyaway hair.
UMBRIDGE
I MEAN LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME!
I really cannot take it anymore...
(then)
But I must! Authority must be
upheld! Sometimes the ends do
justify the means--and certainly
no one could blame me...
(MORE)

UMBRIDGE (CONT'D)
(steeling herself)
...and if it falls to me to sort
out the mess--to tie up the loose
ends--then so be it. For the
greater good I will do what must
be done--
She raises her wand--
A GUTTURAL VOICE barks in an ANCIENT TONGUE.
Umbridge whirls...slowly looks up as a CENTAUR (MAGORIAN)
steps forward. He has long black hair; his face and body
are covered with WAR MARKINGS. He holds a cocked BOW in
his powerful arms.
UMBRIDGE
Y-You have no business here,
Centaur! This is a Ministry
matter...
Magorian reacts--SPEAKS LOW as another Centaur--BANE--
steps forward, bow also raised. Nervously:
UMBRIDGE
Lower your weapons! I warn you--
any attack on a Ministry Official
by a half-breed is--
Bane spits a furious RESPONSE to Magorian. More CENTAURS
step forward as Umbridge continues, growing hysterical--
UMBRIDGE
Under the law, as creatures of
near-human intelligence--
ZING--Bane looses an arrow. It sails toward Umbridge--
who RAISES her WAND--PROTEGO!--the arrow bounces
harmlessly to the side.
UMBRIDGE
HOW DARE YOU! FILTHY HALF-BREED--!
(raising her WAND)
CRUCIO!
Bane stumbles in agony. Hermione SCREAMS. Umbridge's eyes
gleam as she uses her wand to force the proud Centaur to
its knees--it STUMBLES, rolls down the hill to her feet--
HERMIONE
STOP IT! STOP!
The CENTAURS on the ridge DRAW THEIR BOWS--Umbridge
raises her wand--
--as Hermione throws herself in front of the fallen
Centaur; Harry quickly joining her.
107.
UMBRIDGE
ENOUGH! I WILL--HAVE--ORDER--!!
She aims her wand--
--suddenly a tree trunk CRACKS behind her, as a giant
HAND grabs Umbridge around the waist--she drops her
wand--
Umbridge looks up in speechless horror as GRAWP glares
furiously down at her through broken yellow teeth.
GRAWP
NO--HURT--HERMY--!
HERMIONE
(touched)
He remembered...
Umbridge SCREAMS. The CENTAURS REAR UP at the towering
Giant--
UMBRIDGE
UNHAND ME, YOU ANIMAL!
Annoyed, Grawp covers her mouth with his thumb, muffling
her continuing SCREAMS. As the Centaurs recover, advance
on Grawp with drawn bows Harry and Hermione share a
frightened look--
HERMIONE
No--please! He doesn't understand!
A timeless beat as GRAWP frowns uneasily at the Centaurs...
then slowly looks down at Umbridge, putting two and two
together. She looks up at him in dawning horror...
UMBRIDGE
Now--now listen here...
(calls, desperately)
POTTER--DO SOMETHING--TELL THEM I
MEAN NO HARM--!
HARRY
I'm sorry, Professor...I must not
tell lies.
Umbridge's eyes widen--Grawp sniffs her head dubiously.
Makes a disgusted face--
--then absently DROPS her. Magorian is already signaling
two Centaurs--who instantly gallop alongside Umbridge,
each grabbing an arm. Her legs kick uselessly in the air--
UMBRIDGE
UNHAND ME YOU BEASTS--you ANIMALS!!
I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores
Jane Umbridge! Let me GOOOooo---!!
108.
Her SCREAMING dwindles as she is borne away over the
ridge, the other CENTAURS folding in behind her...
...as Magorian helps Bane back to his feet. Still burning
with humiliation, Bane suddenly DRAWS HIS BOW on Harry
and Hermione. They freeze in fear--but Magorian puts a
hand on Bane's shoulder, staying him.
BANE
(seething)
You cannot trust them--they are
humans.
MAGORIAN
They are young. We do not attack
foals.
BANE
Not so young--
(he aims at Harry, who
holds his breath)
This one is nearing manhood.
MAGORIAN
True...But there remains the scent
of innocence about him.
A tense moment of standoff between the two Centaurs--
then Bane snorts in disgust, turns and gallops away.
Harry and Hermione sag in relief as Magorian turns to
them; quietly:
MAGORIAN
Go, humans.
He too gallops off...as Harry and Hermione turn to find
Grawp has wandered off and is now sitting in the middle
of a BED OF FLOWERS. He's still sniffing his Umbridge
hand dubiously as they approach.
HERMIONE
Thank you, Grawp.
She stands up on tiptoes to kiss his cheek. Grawp
blushes... then reaches down and pulls up the entire bed
of flowers, gently tosses them toward Hermione. Petals
rain down on her and Harry as they smile gratefully up
at him through the cascade...then Harry turns to Hermione.
HARRY
Sirius.
129A EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DUSK 129A
The setting sun filters through the trees as Harry and
Hermione rush breathlessly through the forest.
109.
130 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST - DUSK 130
As Harry and Hermione emerge from the trees they find
Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna hurrying to meet them. Ron
hands them their wands--
HERMIONE
How did you get away?
RON
Told 'em I was hungry and wanted
some sweets. 'Course they said
bugger off and ate it all
themselves.
GINNY
Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
HERMIONE
(truly impressed)
Ron! That was clever.
RON
(flushing)
It has been known to happen.
NEVILLE
It was brilliant! But how are we
going to get to London...?
Hermione and Ron's eyes go instantly to Harry. Torn:
HARRY
Look...it's not that I don't
appreciate everything you've done,
all of you...but I've got you into
enough trouble as it is, and...
Luna frowns. Hermione just looks at him, terribly
disappointed. Harry frowns...
NEVILLE
(quietly)
Dumbledore's Army was supposed to
be about doing something real. Or
was that all just words to you?
Harry hesitates. Ron looks at him; gently:
RON
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.
A long moment...he takes in their faces...then--an open
appeal:
HARRY
So how are we going to get to
London?
110.
LUNA
(smiling beatifically)
We fly, of course.
131 EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DUSK 131
In rapid succession SIX THESTRALS burst through the
treetops, soar into the fiery sky.
ON HARRY'S FACE--fear, determination, a million emotions,
bathed in the light of the setting sun as the ground
falls away beneath.
132 EXT. SKY/HOGWARTS - FLYING - DUSK 132
The SUN emerges from behind a cloud and GOLDEN LIGHT
illuminates the towers of Hogwarts, FLARING off the
glittering windows, as if in celebration of Umbridge's
defeat.
Harry clings tight to his Thestral's mane as the
formation banks around Dumbledore's Tower...and heads
into the blood-red sunset.
133 EXT. SKY/LONDON - NIGHT 133
The Thestrals SOAR through clouds GLIMMERING with
internal LIGHTNING. They burst from the belly of the
storm to appear over a rain-swept London. As our view
lowers a f.g. building WIPES VERTICALLY--
134 OMITTED 134
& &
135 135
135A INT. ATRIUM - MINISTRY OF MAGIC - NIGHT 135A
--as we BOOM DOWN to reveal the Six standing side by side
in the deserted Atrium. The vast lobby is silent except
for the burbling FOUNTAIN. The others stare in awe, then
look at Harry nervously...
HARRY
It's this way.
136 INT. CORRIDOR - DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES 136
The golden lift grille RUMBLES open to reveal the Six.
LIFT VOICE
Department of Mysteries.
Harry hurries down the corridor, turns the corner--and
stops at the sight of the BLACK DOOR at the end of the
111.
hall. Harry stares; for a moment WHISPERS seem to call
from beyond...then:
HARRY
Stay behind me. Once we've found
Sirius I'll create a diversion--
you just get him out of danger
quick as you can...
HERMIONE
But V-Voldemort...
It's still hard for her to say his name. Harry hesitates--
turns back to the door--
HARRY
(grim)
Leave Voldemort to me.
Harry takes a deep breath. Opens the door--
137 OMITTED 137
138 INT. HALL OF PROPHECY 138
As the DOOR opens into darkness the group nervously
follows Harry in. They notice the door is FLOATING slowly
but methodically across the floor--the corridor still
disorientingly visible beyond. More FREE-STANDING DOORS
drift past ROWS of high SHELVES, lined with rows of ORBS
that give off a weird liquid glow.
HARRY
Lumos.
His WAND TIP FLARES but the black void seems to suck up
all the light. As Harry takes point, the others fall into
an arrow formation behind him.
FROM HIGH ABOVE: The tiny group makes their way through
the blackness...a sudden dark WHOOSH wipes frame--
WITH THE SIX
Their FOOTSTEPS ECHO as we study their nervous faces...
extended wands... trembling hands...
As they approach a CROSSROADS of two WIDER AISLES, Harry
notes the LABELS on the end of each row: ROW 95, 96...97.
Harry silently raises his hand to stop the others, who
exchange nervous glances. Harry flattens himself against
the end of the shelf--slowly peers around the corner,
wand extended...
Empty.
112.
Harry stares--then moves quickly to where he saw Sirius
in his vision. He finds only dusty floor.
HARRY
He should be here!
Harry looks around wildly--down row after empty row.
HARRY
(his voice echoing)
SIRIUS!!
(returns)
They've done something with him!
Taken him somewhere else, or--
HERMIONE
(scared)
Harry--what if Sirius was never
here at all?
HARRY
What? But I saw--
HERMIONE
What if Voldemort learned about
the connection between you--and
tricked you into only thinking you
saw him?
Harry stares at her, unwilling to believe it.
NEVILLE (O.S.)
(calls)
Harry...
Harry turns to see Neville peering up at a glowing GLOBE
high on a shelf. He turns to Harry.
NEVILLE
It's got your name on it.
As Harry approaches the SHELF SILENTLY LOWERS ITSELF to
Harry's level, as if presenting the globe to him. The
dusty LABEL beneath it reads: S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D. Dark
Lord and (?) Harry Potter. As the globe reaches Harry
its low throbbing HUM grows more powerful; it lights up
his face with an ethereal GLOW.
Transfixed, Harry reaches for it--
HERMIONE
(worried)
Harry...
HARRY
(simply)
It's got my name on it.
113.
Harry grasps the globe--and is ELECTRIFIED by its power.
SYBILL TRELAWNEY'S VOICE ECHOES in an eerily hollow tone
we've heard once before [NOTE: FROM THE OTHERS' REACTIONS
IT IS CLEAR ONLY HARRY HEARS THIS]:
TRELAWNEY (V.O.)
The one with the power to vanquish
the Dark Lord approaches...and the
Dark Lord will mark him as his
equal, but he will have power the
Dark Lord knows not...and either
must die at the hand of the other
for neither can live while the
other survives...
A DISTANT SCREAM rapidly grows louder. With enormous
difficulty Harry tears his focus away from the globe--to
find Hermione holding a frightened Ginny--Harry stares
at her in confusion--Ginny points--
Harry turns--to see a TALL, DARK FIGURE, silhouetted
against the blackness--Voldemort? But as it steps into
the light we see its hooded, hideous mask: a DEATH EATER.
LUCIUS MALFOY
Very good, Potter...
TWO MORE DEATH EATERS (DOLOHOV and ROOKWOOD) seem to form
from the shadows behind Malfoy, flanking him. [This
effect should seem somewhat eerie but mostly realistic--
we won't reveal magic is involved until later.]
LUCIUS MALFOY
...now give me the Prophecy.
Harry's eyes widen in confusion. He turns to take in the
endless rows--
HARRY
Sirius--
LUCIUS MALFOY
It's time you learned the
difference between reality and
dreams, Potter--you saw what the
Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now
give. That. To me.
Harry slowly looks down at the globe in his hands. Then:
HARRY
Get behind me.
(the others realize, fall
back. To Malfoy:)
If you want to get to us you're
going to have to smash this first.
[Something tells me your boss
wouldn't be too pleased about
that.]
114.
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE (O.S.)
Oh, he knows how to play, little
bitty baby Potter...
Another Death Eaters HISSES, steps forward. Familiar mad
eyes glitter behind the mask: BELLATRIX LESTRANGE. She
raises her wand--
LUCIUS MALFOY
Bellatrix, no.
NEVILLE
(eyes widening)
Bellatrix Lestrange.
A spark of delighted recognition dawns in Bellatrix' eyes.
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE
Master Longbottom! How's Mum and
Dad?
NEVILLE
B-better, now they're about to be
avenged.
Bellatrix's smile twists into a sneer of rage--she
abruptly raises her wand--
NEVILLE
EXPELLIARMUS!
Just as a JET OF FIERY LIGHT shoots from Bellatrix' wand
Neville's spell PULLS it from her hand. His eyes widen
in amazement as the EXPLOSION rocks the shelf a foot to
Harry's left, SHATTERING several globes. Two SMOKELIKE
FIGURES unfurl from the broken glass, MURMUR inaudibly.
LUCIUS MALFOY
DO NOT ATTACK. WE NEED THAT
PROPHECY.
HARRY
I don't understand. Why did
Voldemort need me to come get it?
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE
Filthy half-blood. You dare speak
his name!
Malfoy restrains Bellatrix; icily:
LUCIUS MALFOY
As those who died trying to acquire
it for the Dark Lord learned--
prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.
(MORE)
115.
LUCIUS MALFOY (CONT'D)
(changing tacks;
seductively)
Haven't you ever wondered why the
Dark Lord tried to kill you as an
infant? The reason for the
connection between you? The
secret...of your scar? You hold
the answer in your hands. Come--
let me show it to you...
Harry looks down at the glowing orb--hesitates--then:
HARRY
I've been waiting fourteen years...
I guess I can wait a little longer.
NOW--!!
HERMIONE/RON/GINNY/NEVILLE/LUNA
STUPEFY!
Five JETS of LIGHT EXPLODE OUTWARD, sending an equal
number of Death Eaters CRASHING into the shelves of
PROPHECIES--
HARRY
RUN!!
FIERY JETS OF LIGHT CRACKLE through the air as the Six
SCATTER IN ALL DIRECTIONS. ARROWS OF LIGHT EXPLODE GLOBES
left and right, lighting up the darkness--
--as we CRANE UP TO REVEAL for the first time the VAST
SCALE OF THE ROOM--INFINITELY TALL SHELVES stretching AS
FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE--
LUNA
races down an aisle, looking behind her in terror--and
runs straight into a huge DEATH EATER. She stares up at
him in horror--turns to run but he grabs her brutally
around the neck. Kicking and struggling desperately, she
spots his DARK MARK floating on his arm--and suddenly
BITES it, hard. The Death Eater cries out, drops her.
Luna scrambles away on hands and knees--
--and runs right into another DEATH EATER. As the two
advance on her she looks wildly back and forth--
The first Death Eater raises his wand--FIRES--but at the
last second Luna DIVES for cover, the JET OF FIRE
SIZZLING JUST OVER HER HEAD, singeing her hair--it hits
the second Death Eater, sending him flying into a shelf--
and giving Luna the diversion she needs to fire a BLAST
at the first, who goes sprawling.
As Luna scrambles through a small GAP between Globes on
the bottom shelf, we TRACK THROUGH IT WITH HER--
116.
She climbs to her feet in the adjacent aisle, starts to
run. But as she rounds a corner...
...she suddenly slows to a halt, confused. She tilts her
head quizzically...as we come around to reveal what she's
seeing:
NEVILLE
stands stunned and mute, wand in hand, looking down at a
PETRIFIED DEATH EATER, his arms still reaching skywards
clutching at nothing. Neville seems equally frozen,
utterly stunned at his accomplishment.
For a long moment Luna just stands there, breathing hard,
staring at Neville, breathing hard, staring at the Death
Eater, not breathing at all. Finally:
LUNA
Well done, Neville.
Neville remains utterly oblivious,. Another endless
moment of mutual breathing...and then an EXPLOSION goes
off nearby. Startled into action, Luna grabs Neville by
the hand--
LUNA
Come on, Neville. You can do it
some more.
As she pulls Neville off he continues to stare back at
the frozen Death Eater in stunned amazement...
...as we abruptly TRACK laterally THROUGH THE SHELVES,
to FIND
RON AND HERMIONE
racing down an aisle, SHOOTING OFF SPELLS behind them as
they are pursued by Two Death Eaters. Hermione wings one
of them but the other remains hot on their trail. Seeing
the GHOSTLY FOG inside some of the Prophecies she's
running past, Hermione gets an idea--
--and USES HER WAND to TRIP a ROW OF PROPHECIES off their
stands. Ron, realizing what she's doing, immediately does
likewise--
In rapid succession orbs EXPLODE on the floor like giant
light bulbs. RISING MURMURING GHOSTLY FIGURES obscure
the Death Eater's view; as he struggles through the mist
RED BOLTS of FIRE FLASH in the fog around him; he takes
a HIT, VANISHING into the fog--
--as Ron and Hermione approach the end of the aisle
suddenly a HUGE DEATH EATER appears from the darkness,
blocking their way. A FLASH of LIGHT as Ron takes a HIT
to his arm, goes flying--
117.
HERMIONE
Ron--!
--but before she can say another word the Death Eater
uses his wand to FLOAT HERMIONE INTO THE AIR--she
SCREAMS--
--Hermione's eyes find Ron's, plead--"do something!" With
steely resolve Ron scrambles for his wand, takes aim--
RON
STUPEFY--!!
The Death Eater goes SPINNING round and CRASHING into
the shelves--as a shower of PROPHECIES rain down on him,
knocking him out cold--
--but leaving Hermione floating in mid-air. We STAY WITH
HER as she SCREAMS, tumbling through space--
--abruptly stopping as she lands in Ron's arms. Ron is
as just as stunned as Hermione, who stares at Ron, as if
seeing him with new eyes. Finally:
RON
Better keep running.
HERMIONE
(instantly)
Right.
They race off--
TRACKING WITH HARRY
on the run through the maze. As he races through the
endless disorienting rows and aisles we hear VOICES CRY
out in the darkness. Suddenly a DEATH EATER seems almost
to form from the shadows right in front of him--Harry
sends it flying with a STUPEFY, races back the other
way--only to find another APPEAR--seemingly out of
nowhere--before him. HARRY sends it too flying, but--
nightmarishly--TWO MORE instantly take its place. He
turns again--to see MALFOY striding toward him, wand
extended, ROARING--
LUCIUS MALFOY
GIVE IT TO ME--!
Again Harry turns to run--but he's surrounded--
--and then his eyes lock onto
GINNY
breathing hard, visible watching THROUGH the prophecies
on a shelf. They lock eyes. She raises her wand, takes a
deep breath--
118.
GINNY
REDUCTO!
A massive EXPLOSION takes out the bottom of the shelf
beyond--the Death Eaters whirl--to see the towering shelf
SWAY--TIP--
Harry runs--DIVES and ROLLS as a huge piece of shelf
barely misses him--and CRASHES on top of Malfoy and the
Death Eaters--
--who at the last instant IMPLODE INTO BLACK SMOKE--
[accompanied by a SONIC BOOM effect] their PLUMES ROCKET
up THROUGH the fallen shelf and high into the AIR--
Harry and Ginny stare in breathless amazement--that's
how these guys have been moving so fast. And they realize
something else: they're utterly out of their depth.
GINNY
Y-you were right, Harry. This
isn't at all like being in school.
Suddenly a DEEP RUMBLING is heard. As Harry and Ginny
slowly turn their eyes widen in disbelief:
The falling SHELF has caused a CHAIN REACTION--SHELF
after SHELF toppling like the worlds largest dominos.
Headed straight for them.
Harry grabs Ginny's hand as they race away from the
chaos--and down the long aisle toward the distant doors.
TWENTY YARDS AHEAD of them Neville and Luna suddenly
spill into the main aisle, also racing for the line of
DOORS--after a moment Ron and Hermione tumble out of
another aisle, joining Neville and Luna--
HIGH ANGLE - PLUME'S POV
We DIVE TOWARD THE SMALL FIGURES of HARRY and GINNY,
smashing THROUGH the shelves, exploding GLOBES left and
right--raining FIRE down on Harry and Ginny--
GINNY
CRIES out in pain as BOLT hits her leg; she stumbles.
Looks behind her in terror at the approaching WAVE OF
DESTRUCTION. Harry quickly helps her up, holds her as
she limps bravely onward--
NEAR THE DOOR the four look helplessly as the Wave
approaches Harry and Ginny--
HERMIONE
HURRY!
119.
Now Harry and Ginny are almost at the door--which begins
to swing shut. Behind them the wave of CRASHING SHELVES
has almost reached them; converging BOLTS OF FIRE are
RAINING DOWN, one SINGEING Luna's hair--another hitting
Ron in the arm as he pushes Ginny ahead of him--the group
dives into the blackness just as the door SLAMS SHUT
behind them--
139 OMITTED 139
140 INT. VEIL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 140
Blackness. Silence. We hear approaching CRIES--and as
the Six suddenly FALL into frame we instantly PLUMMET
WITH THEM. TILT DOWN to see far below a FLOOR of ROUGH
STONE flying up at us--
At the last second an UPWARD BLAST OF WIND arrests their
fall and deposits them--OOF--in a pile--the GLOBE
miraculously still intact in Harry's hands.
Bruised and battered, the Six pull themselves to their
feet. Ron helps Hermione up...mutters:
RON
"Department of Mysteries..." Got
that one right, didn't they...
And now as the Six look around we see they are standing
on huge stones that make up the floor of a vast
AMPHITHEATER, its RISERS dwindling into infinity.
In the center of the space is a DAIS, upon which stands
a cracked and crumbling STONE ARCHWAY. It is hung with a
tattered BLACK VEIL, which sways eerily in an invisible
breeze. The WHISPERS we've been hearing in Harry's dreams
are quite loud here--this, apparently, is their source.
Mesmerized, Harry steps onto the dais, approaches the
veil. He shivers as frigid BREEZE blows through it.
HARRY
The voices. Can you tell what
they're saying?
Ron and Hermione share a chilled look.
HERMIONE
There aren't any voices, Harry.
Let's get out of here--
Luna approaches the fluttering veil, rapt. The breeze
rustles her hair.
LUNA
I hear them too.
120.
HERMIONE
It's just an empty archway! Please
Harry, they'll be here any--
Too late. A HOWLING WIND draws her gaze upwards--where
HIGH ABOVE, TEN PLUMES OF THICK BLACK SMOKE are billowing
toward them.
Harry looks around. There's no where to run.
The Six stand abreast. The PLUMES SCREAM in. SIX WANDS
RISE in unison--
THE SIX
STUPEFY--!!
--but it's too late--their voices are swallowed in the
deafening WIND as now TWO MORE PLUMES sweep down behind
them from opposite directions--the Six spin in confusion--
And then the other PLUMES are there, SPIRALING DOWN
AROUND THEM, creating a TORNADO EFFECT. As the grotesque
forms of half-reconstituted Death Eaters HOWL PAST one
by one each of the kids is SUCKED into the maelstrom.
Finally only Harry is left, hugging the Prophecy to his
chest--
And then suddenly the ROAR of the wind dwindles to
silence. Harry looks up from the ground--to see each of
his friends held at wandpoint in a circle around him.
Malfoy begins to laugh.
LUCIUS MALFOY
Did you actually believe...Were
you really naive enough to think
that children stood a chance
against...us?
Harry looks helplessly at the others. Malfoy holds out
his hand.
LUCIUS MALFOY
The Prophecy.
NEVILLE
(his nose bleeding)
DON'T GIB IT TO DEM, HARRY!
Dolohov roughly twists Neville's arm behind his back.
LUCIUS MALFOY
I'll make it easy for you, Potter.
Give it to me now...or watch them
die.
Beaten, Harry haltingly steps forward...and hands Malfoy
the Prophecy. Malfoy raises the glowing orb up to his
face, illuminating a cruel smile:
121.
LUCIUS MALFOY
Kill the spares. [ALT: Kill them.]
QUICK CUTS: Harry stares. Ron and Hermione exchange a
last look. Ginny and Luna clasp hands. Neville steels
himself, looks unblinkingly at--
BELLATRIX. Grinning horribly, she raises her wand--draws
an ecstatic breath to cast the killing spell--
--then suddenly her wand goes flying from her hand--
Rookwood and Dolohov's are stripped from theirs as well--
Harry whirls--all heads turn--to see SIRIUS step from
shadow into light, his dark eyes shining.
SIRIUS
Get away from my Godson.
And with that he PUNCHES Malfoy brutally in the jaw--
--as the Prophecy goes sailing out of his hands. Malfoy
stares in stunned disbelief as it SMASHES on the stone.
As the pearly-white figure of SYBILL TRELAWNEY rises from
the broken glass and DISSOLVES INTO SMOKE Malfoy falls
to his knees, holds up the broken shards in horror--
LUCIUS MALFOY
No...
Now the SOUND of RUSHING WIND spins the heads of the
stunned Death Eaters as a WHITE VAPOR TRAIL circles in
from above--
--as the kids use the diversion to elbow, kick and pull
free of their captors. Simultaneously Sirius grabs Harry,
pulls him to the ground just as the VAPOR TRAIL ROCKETS
OVERHEAD--and an ARC of WHITE LIGHTNING shoots from it,
FORKING and SPLITTING into multiple BOLTS that send Death
Eaters flying left and right--
--as the WHITE PLUME COALESCES into Tonks, spinning
balletically as she lands gracefully on the run--
--suddenly TRIPS--
--then catches herself at the last moment, sticking her
landing. MORE WHITE VAPOR TRAILS are streaming in from
all directions; in disarray, the DEATH EATERS fire spells
off wildly as the WHITE PLUMES COALESCE into Lupin--
Moody--Shacklebolt--all in motion, wands blazing. Tonks
quickly helps shepherd the KIDS out of harms way as THE
BATTLE BEGINS--
SIMULTANEOUS ACTION
HIGH ON A RISER MADEYE MOODY is in his glory, sending
spells BOOMING left and right. A DEATH EATER comes at
him from behind--but Moody's EYE SPINS in his socket--
122.
MADEYE MOODY
Oh no you don't, Boyo--
Moody ELBOWS him brutally, grabs him, yanks him around
and HEAD BUTTS him. As Moody watches him crash down the
risers, he takes a hit from his flask, BELCHES with
satisfaction--
A DEATH EATER SCREAMS like a banshee as he flies toward
Shacklebolt--who just calmly fires a carefully aimed shot
that sends him twirling fifty feet through the air. Just
then ROOKWOOD ROCKETS UPWARDS, transforming into a black
PLUME as he sends FIRE raining down on Shacklebolt--who,
without missing a beat, aims over his shoulder--
--and hits the BILLOWING TRAIL dead on. Rookwood
RECONSTITUTES in mid-air--plummets, FLAILING helplessly--
as Shacklebolt whirls with a flourish, wand already
sweeping toward its next target--
SIRIUS
leans over Harry in concern; helps him sit up. They are
just out of the battlezone, in the SHADOW of the ARCH.
SIRIUS
Harry--are you all right?
Harry is overwhelmed with joy and relief at seeing his
Godfather unharmed.
HARRY
Sirius...I thought...I mean I saw...
SIRIUS
(gently)
I know. But's it all right. I'm
fine.
(a moment...then an
EXPLOSION goes off nearby)
Listen to me: I want you to take
the others and get out of here--
HARRY
What? No! I'm staying with you!
SIRIUS
Harry--
HARRY
Sirius, I won't lose you again!
Sirius looks at his Godson. For a moment the SOUNDS of
the BATTLE grow distant.
123.
SIRIUS
Harry...my life...has largely been
a wasted one. Twelve years in
Azkaban. Living on the run. The
one good thing in it...has been
you. Don't take that away from me.
(Harry is torn)
Besides...
Sirius is looking beyond him. Harry turns, follows his
gaze...to where where Tonks is helping the other kids,
bruised and battered. Luna is still very shaky; Ron helps
the limping Ginny.
SIRIUS
They need their leader.
Harry looks at his friends--back at Sirius--and finally,
reluctantly nods. Sirius smiles--
BOOM! Harry darts across the no-man's land of EXPLOSIONS
and strobing colored LIGHT. As he reaches the others,
headed toward the amphitheater DOORWAY, Tonks squeezes
his shoulder, then rushes back into the fray. As Harry
watches her go he takes a last look at the battle--his
searching eyes find Shacklebolt--Lupin--then
SIRIUS
dueling Malfoy before the VEIL. BOLTS of FIRE explode
from their wands as they circle, each seeking the high
ground. Malfoy is good--very good. He battles Sirius back,
gaining the advantage--
LUCIUS MALFOY
You should have stayed in hiding,
Black!
SIRIUS
When I'm done with you, Malfoy--
(deftly tossing his wand
from hand to hand)
--you'll wish I had.
Sirius backs up onto the DAIS, sends a multicolored
BARRAGE OF FLAMES at Malfoy. Malfoy ducks behind the
Arch--but suddenly a BOLT comes at Sirius from behind--
he spins to find BELLATRIX. She HISSES as she fires
again--he nimbly dodges it.
SIRIUS
Come now Cousin, we can do better
than that!
Bellatrix fires--but as Sirius moves to evade it he is
blocked by another SIZZLING BOLT from Malfoy--and Sirius
takes a painful HIT in the side--
124.
HARRY, watching, sucks in his breath--looks at Ron and
Hermione, also riveted, torn--
SIRIUS' eyes grow hard as he summons all his power--sends
a massive CRACKLING ELECTRIC BOLT, frying Bellatrix as
she's hurled SCREAMING through the air and out of sight--
Now DOLOHOV flies to Malfoy's aide. Together they use
their wands to press Sirius back against the VEIL. As
Sirius struggles against the crushing force of the spell,
ROOKWOOD dives down from above, sending FIRE raining down
on Sirius. Paralyzed, he struggles to roll clear--takes
another agonizing HIT--
HARRY
Can't take it anymore. Hermione sees it. With quiet
urgency:
HERMIONE
Go.
MALFOY AND DOLOHOV
advance on the pinned Sirius, wands extended--Sirius is
helpless as Malfoy moves in for the kill--
LUCIUS MALFOY
The Dark Lord will be pleased
indeed. Today will see both the
end of Harry Potter--and the Order
of the Phoenix!
Suddenly Malfoy is BLASTED, sent flying. A wild-eyed
Sirius looks up to see HARRY--
SIRIUS
Good one, James!
Harry stares at Sirius. Dolohov sends a BOLT OF FIRE at
him--who dodges as he spins back into action. Caught in
the crossfire, Harry and Sirius are dueling back to back.
Sirius is ebullient, taking all comers.
And then IN THE FOREGROUND a bloodied BELLATRIX rises
into view, unseen. She takes shaky aim at Sirius--at the
last second Harry sees--
HARRY
Sirius, look out--!
SIRIUS
It's all right Harry! I'm back--
He laughs triumphantly as Bellatrix FIRES--
--and a jet of light hits Sirius squarely on the chest.
His laughter is still ringing as his eyes widen in
surprise--
125.
Time slows, sound fades.
Harry and Sirius lock eyes as Sirius goes sprawling
backwards in SLOW MOTION. Terror lights in Harry's eyes.
A look of surprise, and at the last moment, fear glints
in Sirius' eyes as he flies backwards through the ragged
VEIL...and vanishes.
Silence...then SOUND RETURNS with a rush as we hear
Bellatrix' triumphant SCREAM.
HARRY
Sirius?
With dawning horror he starts toward the veil, but Lupin
is there to hold him back.
LUPIN
No, Harry--he's gone.
Harry is stunned. Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna white-
faced. Harry struggles against Lupin's grip, refusing to
believe it.
HARRY
SIRIUS!
Bellatrix is on the run, both Shacklebolt and Tonks
firing after her. A shot hits Tonks'--her face contorts
in pain as her hair turns WHITE.
Bellatrix disappears through the amphitheater DOORWAY--
--as Harry pulls free of Lupin and races after her.
LUPIN
Harry, no--!
141 INT. CORRIDOR - DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - CONTINUOUS 141
Harry emerges from the other side of the doorway--and
stops, disoriented as he realizes--
--he has exited the SAME DOOR they all first went through.
He hears the LIFT jangling at the end of the hall--
142 INT. LIFT LOBBY - MINISTRY OF MAGIC - CONTINUOUS 142
The GRILLE opens as Harry stumbles out the door--
143 INT. ATRIUM - MINISTRY OF MAGIC - CONTINUOUS 143
The vast deserted hall is illuminated only by the glowing,
golden FOUNTAIN.
126.
As Harry enters he spots Bellatrix across the Atrium,
heading for the fireplaces. He raises his wand--
HARRY
CRUCIO!!
Bellatrix SCREAMS as a FLASH of light knocks her off her
feet--
Harry is there. On fire, his wand pointed at her head.
She looks up at him in terror--
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE
(whispers)
No--
ON HARRY
Hatred and murder blazing in his eyes--a timeless moment--
And then from the inky blackness beyond him a bone-white
visage emerges, swims toward us.
VOLDEMORT
(softly)
Do it. [ALT: You've got to mean it,
Harry.]
Voldemort draws closer. He is gentle, sympathetic...
reasonable.
VOLDEMORT
She killed him. She deserves it--
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE
M-master--I tried, but, the
Animagus Black, he--
VOLDEMORT
Don't speak to me. Or can you
restore my broken Prophecy?
Bellatrix is terrified into silence.
VOLDEMORT
You know the spell. Do it--
Bellatrix looks pleadingly at Harry--Harry is on the
brink--his wand trembling--
--and then a flash of LIGHT illuminates his face.
DUMBLEDORE (O.S.)
Harry.
Harry tears his eyes away from Bellatrix...to see
Dumbledore's pained, kindly eyes.
127.
VOLDEMORT
You're too late, old man. The boy
knows the truth.
HARRY
(barely audible)
What truth.
VOLDEMORT
That you've been lied too...
betrayed...just as I once was.
(his eyes burn at
Dumbledore, then:)
Tell me Harry: do you know the
real reason your Godfather died?
HARRY
BECAUSE SHE KILLED HIM--!!
Harry again raises his wand--Bellatrix cringes in terror--
VOLDEMORT
NO. Because he "loved" you.
He spits the word contemptuously.
VOLDEMORT
Why did your mother and father die?
Why will your friends die, when
their turn comes--as it will? What
has this "love" that he exalts
above all else ever brought you
but pain, and despair, and terrible,
terrible loss...?
(intensely)
It doesn't exist, Harry. It's a
fairy tale. A lie that the weak
enshrine--and the shrewd exploit.
DUMBLEDORE
Harry--
VOLDEMORT
Just look at him--the great
Dumbledore! As if he cared a whit
about you--!
HARRY
(like a little boy)
That's not true!
VOLDEMORT
He cares only to the extent you're
useful to him. You're but a pawn
in his great chess match against
me...it's all you've ever been.
And this "love" he professes...
(MORE)
128.
VOLDEMORT (CONT'D)
(quietly)
...that's the greatest illusion of
all. Mine is a hard truth... but
it is the truth. You are alone.
Dumbledore continues to look at Harry.
DUMBLEDORE
It was foolish of you to come here
tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on
their way.
VOLDEMORT
Yes. By which time I shall be gone,
and you dead--
Suddenly a SCALDING ROPE OF FIRE arcs from his wand. With
a SWOOP of his WAND Dumbledore FLINGS Harry out of the
line of fire--he's SLAMMED against the wall, Dumbledore
shielding him like a lion guarding a cub--
--BELLATRIX sees her chance, bolts toward the fireplaces--
--even as Dumbledore's WAND whips around and ANOTHER ROPE
OF FIRE emanates from it, SMASHES into the first--
TIGHT ON HARRY
LIGHTS STROBE and ARC across his face as the two great
Wizards to battle, the very walls TREMBLING. RUBBLE and
SHATTERED TILES fall in slow motion around him. But it
all seems distant, remote as we PUSH IN on Harry, crushed
with grief.
DUMBLEDORE AND VOLDEMORT
are face to face, the power emanating from their wands
blowing back Dumbledore's hair, creating a miniature
HURRICANE around them.
Voldemort sneers contemptuously--and vanishes. Instantly
the fiery rope TRANSFORMS into a FIFTY-FOOT HIGH SERPENT,
HISSING furiously--
With a burst of FLAME Voldemort reappears on the plinth
in the fountain. He watches as the SERPENT rears high
above Dumbledore--strikes--
--and suddenly implodes into smoke, quickly dissipates
revealing an unharmed, albeit slightly-singed Dumbledore.
Voldemort's smile fades--and then the WATER in the pool
begins to RISE UP, covering him like a cocoon of molten
glass. His rippling faceless figure struggles to throw
off the suffocating mass--suddenly goes still as he again
vanishes, and the water CRASHES to the floor--
129.
HARRY
dimly becomes aware of what's going on. SOUND is distant,
swimming...slowly his eyes focus as he looks up--
HARRY'S POV
The surreal sight of the two great Wizards battling.
Flashes of LIGHTNING brilliantly illuminate the darkened
atrium. Harry tries to focus, peers at their faces--
Voldemort, radiating power--Dumbledore grim--
As EXPLOSIONS rock the walls HARRY struggles to clear
his head--
VOLDEMORT
suddenly inhales deeply--focuses intently--
--as a SHOCK WAVE explodes out through his wand. It sends
Dumbledore sprawling, knocking the wind out of him--
--as the wave RADIATES OUTWARD, SHATTERING the glass in
the towering wall of WINDOWS above. The falling deadly
rain SWOOPS OVER VOLDEMORT'S HEAD at the last moment,
directed by his wand into a torrent of SHARDS headed
straight for Dumbledore, still on the floor, still
momentarily DAZED. The GLASS SINGS towards him--
--as just in time Dumbledore grimaces--digs deep--turns
on his elbows--
--producing a SILVERY PATRONUS SHIELD. The GLASS SHARDS
slow, STOP IN MID AIR, QUIVERING as they're caught
between two mighty spells--
Both Dumbledore and Voldemort are straining--stalemated--
And then Dumbledore sees something from the corner of
his eye:
Harry. Shaky, disoriented, barely upright; wand in hand.
Voldemort sees him too--hesitates--
--as Dumbledore uses the diversion to press his
advantage--his PATRONUS SHIELD instantly ENVELOPS the
GLASS, SPIRALS TIGHT AROUND IT and IMPLODES....
...leaving only SAND, which swirls and eddies harmlessly
across the Atrium floor.
Suddenly the great space rings with SILENCE.
Dumbledore climbs wearily to his feet. On the verge of
breakdown, Harry stares at him--winded, sweat on his
brow--as if he doesn't know him.
130.
DUMBLEDORE
(alarmed)
Harry...
Now Harry's eyes are drawn inexorably to Voldemort's
piercing gaze. Harry instinctively stumbles back in fear.
He looks anxiously back and forth between the two wizards,
his wand TREMBLING--
Voldemort regards Harry with genuine pity.
VOLDEMORT
(softly)
So weak...so vulnerable...
...and then--we see it--an idea registers in Voldemort's
eyes. His gaze moves to Dumbledore...
Voldemort smiles.
He closes his eyes, grows still. A WIND starts to rise.
As Dumbledore realizes --
DUMBLEDORE
Harry! Stay where you are--!
--Voldemort vanishes--
Harry stares in confusion--
--and then A BURST OF WIND blows back Harry's hair; he
CONVULSES in agony--
--and then suddenly he goes dead still. His eyes open--
now inert, lifeless--and TWO voices issue from his mouth.
HARRY/VOLDEMORT
You've lost, old man.
Dumbledore stares back in helpless horror--
--as one last time we PUSH INTO HARRY'S EYE--ZZZP--
A KALEIDOSCOPIC FLURRY OF IMAGES
A BLUR of random shots of Harry from throughout the films
flash by, too quick to grasp--it is as if Voldemort is
rifling through Harry's brain. Simultaneously a SUPERSONIC
WHINE rises in pitch, becomes excruciating--ZZZP--
ZZZP--FLASH CUT--Sirius being blown back through the veil,
fear rising in his eyes--
IN THE ATRIUM: Harry CONVULSES with pain--
ZZZP--FLASH CUT: YOUNG JAMES laughs as he floats Young
Snape in mid-air--
131.
IN THE ATRIUM: Harry again CONVULSES in agony. His SKIN
grows pale as death--
ZZZP--FLASH CUT: Harry stands staring down at the
terrified Bellatrix, on the brink of murder--his wand
trembling, his face contorted with hate--
ZZZP--Harry once again stands before the MIRROR of ERISED,
hidden from us. He stares into it as we COUNTER TO REVEAL
HARRY'S REFLECTION: IT IS VOLDEMORT. Harry tries
desperately to avert his eyes--
VOLDEMORT
LOOK AT ME!
ZZZP. For a split second we are back in the Atrium--Harry
CRIES OUT.
HARRY
NO...
--and then abruptly his eyes again go dead.
HARRY/VOLDEMORT
He knows the truth, Dumbledore.
(he smiles)
I am too strong.
DUMBLEDORE
Don't fight him Harry! You can't
win, not on his terms.
For an moment Harry is himself again--he stares back at
Dumbledore uncomprehendingly...
...and then all SOUND drains from the scene. Time is
suspended.
Harry stares at Dumbledore's ancient, anguished face--
half in deep shadow, half in light...then:
SIRIUS (O.S.)
We've all got both light and dark
inside us...
Suddenly Harry is back in the Tapestry room with Sirius.
SIRIUS
What matters is the part we choose
to act on...
FLASH CUT: ADULT JAMES smiles out at us from the Photo
of the Original Order, his arm around Sirius...
SIRIUS
That's who we really are.
Harry looks up at his smiling Godfather...then:
132.
YOUNG LILY (O.S.)
Why do you hate him so?
Confused, Harry turns toward the voice--
--and finds himself on a familiar lawn, now empty except
for YOUNG LILY.
FLASH CUT--ADULT LILY turns in terror, holding INFANT
HARRY--
HARRY
Because he murdered you!
Young Lily just looks sadly, compassionately at Harry.
He stares at her in confusion, as the scene WHITES OUT--
IN THE ATRIUM, HARRY is fading. His heartbeat ECHOES as
he starts to pass out. We sense this is his final moment.
And then a distant VOICE reverberates through Harry's
mind...
TRELAWNEY (V.O.)
...but he will have power the Dark
Lord knows not...
Dumbledore looks deeply into Harry's eyes. Softly:
DUMBLEDORE
Harry...it's not how you are
alike--it's how you're not.
Confusion...then the glimmer of understanding begins to
grow in Harry's eyes. And now something draws his gaze
beyond Dumbledore--
Ron and Hermione, breathless and fearful at the entrance
of the smoking, ruined Atrium.
Something clicks in Harry's head. His eyes widen as he
REALIZES--
HARRY
(whispers, realizing)
You're the one who's weak! [ALT:
You're not strong. You're weak.]
He looks back at Ron and Hermione, gazing helplessly at
him...then Luna, Neville, and Ginny appear behind them,
bloody but unbowed. Tonks and Lupin quickly follow.
Harry looks back. With the last of his strength--
HARRY
You'll never know friendship--or
love, or real happiness--and I--
FEEL--SORRY--FOR--YOU--!
133.
ZZZP--for a second Harry again stands before Voldemort's
reflection--
--as with a final surge of defiance Harry SMASHES the
Mirror--
IN THE ATRIUM--Harry is suddenly buffeted by a violent
WIND--
--and then Voldemort is standing above him like a dark
shadow. But his expression betrays no anger, or weakness.
Instead it shows an almost humane sadness. With the
smallest gesture of his hand Voldemort FLOATS Harry's
limp form upright, bringing them face to face.
VOLDEMORT
You are a fool, Harry Potter...
He reaches out to gently touch Harry's face.
VOLDEMORT
And you will lose everything.
A suspended moment--the world is FROZEN around the two
of them--then--
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!--FIREPLACES IGNITE in a quick succession
of EMERALD BURSTS; loud VOICES ECHO all over the Atrium
as FUDGE enters--stops, dumbstruck--
Voldemort looks evenly at Harry--and with another BLAST
OF WIND he TWIRLS UP INTO THE AIR--VANISHES --
--as Harry collapses to the floor.
And then Dumbledore is there, gently touching his face
as Harry, shivering, stares up into his kindly eyes
through his shattered glasses. In a moment they are
surrounded by MINISTRY OFFICIALS--and a stunned Cornelius
Fudge, pajamas visible under his robes. VOICES cry "I
saw him!" "It was Voldemort, he was here!"
Dumbledore looks up from Harry, his hard eyes meeting
Fudge's...as Fudge sags in defeat.
FUDGE
He's back.
The scene is a chaos of rushing wizards, as Dumbledore
turns lovingly back to Harry, who has finally passed out.
144 OMITTED 144
THRU THRU
147 147
148 EXT. LAWN - DAY 148
BUTTERFLIES flutter on a beautiful summer's day.
134.
TRACK PAST students out on the lawn, subdued, reading
the Sunday Prophet: HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED RETURNS,
and, beneath, Dumbledore, Potter Vindicated. Below, a
miserable-looking FUDGE cringes from reporters beneath
the headline FUDGE JUDGED...Minister to Resign?
Suddenly we FLY through the paper, as we continue up the
lawn...
...toward a group of SLYTHERINS: Another page shows a
MUGSHOT of Lucius Malfoy, with the headline AZKABAN'S
LATEST RESIDENT. His livid scowl comes to life as we
again fly through--WHOOSH-to find Draco, seething...
Continue TRACKING; the next paper shows UMBRIDGE, with
accompanying headline: UMBRIDGE SUSPENDED PENDING
INVESTIGATION. As we soar through her--WHOOSH--we begin
to HEAR a familiar brogue...
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL (O.S.)
"...we urge the magical population
to remain vigilant. The Ministry
is currently publishing guides to
elementary defense for all
Wizarding homes..."
As we reach Professor McGonagall, sitting in a wheelchair,
she lowers her paper, looks up at HAGRID beside her. As
the SUNLIGHT FADES they both look up. A PEAL OF THUNDER--
149 INT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 149
RAIN patters the window, blurring the view of the KIDS
far below, hurrying inside holding their newspapers over
their heads.
PAN to FIND Harry, standing in the open doorway, a NOTE
in his hand. The office is apparently empty. He hesitates,
clearly not wanting to be here. Impulsively turns to go--
DUMBLEDORE (O.S.)
Harry?
Harry stops. Dumbledore turns--he is in a chair on the
UPPER LEVEL of his office, facing the window. Subdued.
DUMBLEDORE
Please. Come in?
Harry hesitates. Unable to meet his gaze, he moves to
the wall, his eyes falling on the artifacts of his
youth...the SORTING HAT, GRYFFINDOR'S SWORD. He touches
its blade...Dumbledore watches, uncertain how to begin.
DUMBLEDORE
Harry...I know how you must be
feeling...
135.
HARRY
(simply)
No. You don't.
(then, his voice catching)
It's my fault.
DUMBLEDORE
No, Harry....the fault is mine.
(Harry turns in surprise)
If I had been open with you, as I
should have been, you would have
known long ago that Voldemort
might try and lure you to the
Department of Mysteries. You would
never have been tricked into going
there... and Sirius would not have
come after you. The blame lies
with me, and with me alone. An old
man's mistake...
HARRY
(stares)
You're Dumbledore. You don't make
mistakes.
DUMBLEDORE
Harry...as much as it pains me to
disillusion you, I am all too
fallible...and this war that has
now begun may just as easily be
lost as won.
THUNDER RUMBLES. For the first time Harry really looks
at Dumbledore. He looks different since his battle with
Voldemort. He looks, for the first time...old. Dumbledore
turns to the window, RAIN now sheeting down it.
DUMBLEDORE
I knew it was only a matter of
time before Voldemort became aware
of the connection between you, and
tried to exploit it. I thought by
distancing myself from you, as I
have all year, he would be less
tempted, and you might thereby be
protected. Another mistake...
(turning to him)
I'm sorry, Harry.
Harry doesn't know what to say...then notices Dumbledore's
HAND is TREMBLING. As Dumbledore massages his wrist Harry
seems struck by this sign of frailty. Struggling:
HARRY
The Prophecy said "neither can
live while the other one
survives..."
(MORE)
136.
HARRY (CONT'D)
(looking up)
It means one of us has got to kill
the other in the end?
DUMBLEDORE
Yes.
HARRY
Why didn't you tell me?
DUMBLEDORE
(quietly)
For the same reason you tried to
save Sirius. For the same reason
your friends saved you.
(Harry doesn't understand)
The reason I failed to tell
you...was because after all these
years...after all you've suffered...
I couldn't bear to cause you any
more pain. I cared too much. I
acted exactly as Voldemort expects
we fools who love to act.
Something releases in Harry. As Dumbledore rests a gentle
hand on his shoulder, Harry looks out at the rain, not
wanting Dumbledore to see his tears.
150 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT 150
Harry is packing. Ron appears in the doorway, subdued.
RON
Feast's about to start.
HARRY
Thanks Ron...but I'm not really in
the mood.
Ron frowns, hesitates.
RON
You know...I'm not really that
hungry. I could...
HARRY
(smiles, grateful)
No, you go on. I'll be all right.
151 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 151
Ron comes down the stairs, looks up at a hopeful
Hermione... and shakes his head.
137.
151A INT. MARBLE STAIR - NIGHT 151A
A tired FILCH grumbles as he restores the last of the
PORTRAITS (its PIQUED OCCUPANTS grumbling as well) as
the last few STUDENTS hurry down towards the Great Hall.
Reveal Harry, watching from above...and then he sees
someone watching him from the opposite balcony.
Cho.
Harry looks at her...and doesn't know what to say. She
looks wistfully back at him for a long moment...then
turns away, and starts down the stairs.
152 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 152
Harry's footsteps ECHO as he wanders the deserted
corridor. In the distance we hear SOUNDS of the Feast.
Harry slows as he notices another lone figure: Luna,
posting a NOTICE. Harry hesitates, but she's already seen
him; she smiles, waves. Harry joins her.
HARRY
How come you're not at the feast?
LUNA
I'm trying to find my possessions.
Apparently people have been hiding
them.
HARRY
That's awful.
LUNA
Oh, it's all good fun...but as
it's last night I really do need
them back.
HARRY
D'you want help finding them?
Luna smiles, shakes her head. Then, softly:
LUNA
I'm sorry about your Godfather,
Harry.
She squeezes his hand. It's a small gesture, but somehow
coming from Luna it means an enormous amount to Harry.
HARRY
You sure you don't want help
looking?
138.
LUNA
That's all right. Anyway, my Mum
always said the things we lose
have a way of coming back to us in
the end...
Her gaze rises...to find her SHOES, tied together,
hanging from a chandelier. Luna sighs.
LUNA
...if not always in the way we
expect.
(a moment, then)
I think I'll just go and have some
pudding.
She smiles beatifically, then turns and goes. Harry looks
after her, thoughtful...
153 EXT. HOGSMEADE STATION - DAY 153
The comfortable chaos of homeward-bound STUDENTS make
their way toward the train.
PULL BACK to include the trio, pulling their trunks. They
pause for a moment on the outskirts, reluctant to face
the final moment of leavetaking.
HARRY
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said.
HERMIONE
What's that, Harry?
HARRY
Even though we've got a fight
ahead of us...we've also got one
thing Voldemort doesn't have.
RON
What's that?
HARRY
(quietly)
Something worth fighting for.
He puts a hand on each of their shoulders, more grateful
than ever for their friendship. Both Ron and Hermione
look back, moved...
...and as the trio moves forward into the crowd they are
joined by an excited Neville, Luna and Ginny...and then
still more friends from Dumbledore's Army...and even some
Slytherins offer shy smiles and grateful nods, as the
train BLASTS STEAM...
139.
... and our VIEW RISES to INCLUDE the SPIRES of Hogwarts,
glowing and radiant before the gathering storm, as we
FADE TO BLACK.
