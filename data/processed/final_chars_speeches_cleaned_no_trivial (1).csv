goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,5,"NO! The boy is everything, it cannot"
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,7,"Good. First, gather our old comrades."
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,8,Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,9,Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,11,Are you alright?
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,13,Just now. You?
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,15,Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,17,"Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready."
goblet_of_fire,RON,20,Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?
goblet_of_fire,RON,52,"Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?"
goblet_of_fire,RON,63,There's no one like Krum. He's like
goblet_of_fire,RON,69,Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.
goblet_of_fire,RON,87,Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
goblet_of_fire,RON,88,"On second thought, just the drewbals."
goblet_of_fire,RON,90,"Just the drewbals, thanks."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,95,"This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?"
goblet_of_fire,RON,96,"Loads according to Dad, that's what"
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,97,"It's hurting again isn't it, your scar."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,99,"You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream."
goblet_of_fire,RON,116,"Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody."
goblet_of_fire,RON,127,"Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,129,Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,130,"There's a reason those curses are unforgivable,"
goblet_of_fire,RON,132,"Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be"
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,136,It's not going to work.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,138,You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,140,So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,151,Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
goblet_of_fire,RON,168,How did you do it?
goblet_of_fire,RON,169,Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
goblet_of_fire,RON,171,You know bloody well what.
goblet_of_fire,RON,173,"Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend."
goblet_of_fire,RON,210,Who you talking to?
goblet_of_fire,RON,212,I heard voices.
goblet_of_fire,RON,214,You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,220,Ronald would like me to tell you that
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,223,Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,225,I'm NOT an owl!
goblet_of_fire,RON,252,You think so?
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,268,Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,270,How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,276,Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,287,Your wand harry! Your wand!
goblet_of_fire,RON,298,I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
goblet_of_fire,RON,300,Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.
goblet_of_fire,RON,302,At least I warned you about the dragons.
goblet_of_fire,RON,303,"Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that"
goblet_of_fire,RON,305,Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.
goblet_of_fire,RON,308,Thank you Nigel.
goblet_of_fire,RON,309,Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
goblet_of_fire,RON,310,I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
goblet_of_fire,RON,313,What are you on about?
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,314,They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.
goblet_of_fire,RON,315,Dress robes? for what?
goblet_of_fire,RON,327,"Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?"
goblet_of_fire,RON,332,This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
goblet_of_fire,RON,333,"Well, us and Neville!"
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,334,It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
goblet_of_fire,RON,335,Now I'm really depressed.
goblet_of_fire,RON,336,"Well Hermione, you're a girl."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,337,Oh well spotted.
goblet_of_fire,RON,338,Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,339,I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
goblet_of_fire,RON,341,"Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?"
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,355,No of course.
goblet_of_fire,RON,357,"There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out."
goblet_of_fire,RON,359,What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.
goblet_of_fire,RON,364,What are those??
goblet_of_fire,RON,366,"Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar."
goblet_of_fire,RON,368,Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
goblet_of_fire,RON,369,I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
goblet_of_fire,RON,373,Because nobody asked her. I would have
goblet_of_fire,RON,381,No. Absolutely not.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,385,Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
goblet_of_fire,RON,386,"No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,387,What's got your wand in a knot?
goblet_of_fire,RON,388,He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
goblet_of_fire,RON,389,"Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than"
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,393,How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
goblet_of_fire,RON,394,Doubt it. He's way too old.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,395,What? What? That's what you think?
goblet_of_fire,RON,396,Yeah that is what I think.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,397,You know the solution then don't you.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,399,"Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort."
goblet_of_fire,RON,400,Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,401,Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,404,"Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!"
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,407,"I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean"
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,409,"I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,428,"Harry, tell me again."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,430,"The black lake, that's obvious."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,432,"Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic"
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,434,"Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,435,"But sir, the second task is only hours away and..."
goblet_of_fire,RON,465,Well... yeah... a bit
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,469,Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,471,Next to last.
goblet_of_fire,RON,475,Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
goblet_of_fire,RON,480,We're still misfits.
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,556,Kill the spare.
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,558,"Do it, now!"
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,563,My wand Wormtail.
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,564,Hold out your arm.
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,566,The other arm Wormtail.
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,567,"Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me."
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,568,"Not even you, Lucius."
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,570,"There were signs my friend, and more than whispers."
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,573,"Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.  Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand."
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,575,Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,576,"Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!"
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,577,That's better. And now...
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,578,"Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up."
goblet_of_fire,VOLDEMORT,579,"Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes."
goblet_of_fire,RON,617,Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,620,Everything's going to change now isn't it?
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,622,Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
goblet_of_fire,RON,623,Well I won't. You know I won't!
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,9,"Run along, Wormtail."
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,13,"If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak."
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,14,"As it so happens Iâ€™m aware of your situation, Narcissa."
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,16,"Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable."
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,19,I canâ€™t change the Dark Lordâ€™s mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. To provide some... protection.
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,21,I can try.
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,25,Take out your wand.
half_blood_prince,RON,85,Harry? Did someone say Harry?
half_blood_prince,RON,86,"â€˜Course not. Think Iâ€™d know if my best friend was in my room, wouldnâ€™t I?"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,87,Was that an owl I heard?
half_blood_prince,RON,92,Youâ€™ve a bit of...
half_blood_prince,RON,94,Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts. That itâ€™s too dangerous.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,96,Sheâ€™s not alone. Even my parents
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,98,Thereâ€™s been a lot of chatter
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,112,These are adorable.
half_blood_prince,RON,113,How much for this?
half_blood_prince,RON,114,How much for me?
half_blood_prince,RON,115,But Iâ€™m your brother!
half_blood_prince,RON,116,Câ€™mon. Letâ€™s go.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,119,How is it Fred and George are doing it? Half the alleyâ€™s closed down.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,120,Oh no. Look.
half_blood_prince,RON,122,Is it just me? Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who donâ€™t want to be followed?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,128,I donâ€™t know.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,133,"Stop, Harry, I know where youâ€™re going with this --"
half_blood_prince,RON,134,One of what?
half_blood_prince,RON,135,Youâ€™re barking. What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,136,I told you. I donâ€™t know what I saw.
half_blood_prince,RON,145,Probably on the platform. Câ€™mon.
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,164,"Itâ€™s alright, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy."
half_blood_prince,RON,174,Donâ€™ you worry. Heâ€™ll be â€˜long soon â€˜nuff --
half_blood_prince,RON,175,"Oi! Turn around, you lunatic."
half_blood_prince,RON,186,But I donâ€™t want to take Potions!
half_blood_prince,RON,187,"Ron Weasley, sir. But Iâ€™m dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,192,"Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. And that..."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,193,... is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,207,How did you do that?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,209,No. The instructions specifically say to cut.
half_blood_prince,RON,274,"Really? Strapping guy like you, youâ€™ve got a Beaterâ€™s build, donâ€™t you think? Keeper needs to be agile, quick --"
half_blood_prince,RON,279,"Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one. Hope Cormacâ€™s not taking it too hard."
half_blood_prince,RON,280,"Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,282,No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,284,"Iâ€™d like to know just whose book that was. Letâ€™s take a look, shall we?"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,288,"For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,290,"Well, I was curious. So I went to --"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,292,And... nothing. Thereâ€™s no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,295,"Whatâ€™ve you got there, Hagrid?"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,297,"Stinksap? Youâ€™re not sick, are you?"
half_blood_prince,RON,299,Spider? About six feet tall? Ten feet wide?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,307,"Three Butterbeers. Splash of ginger in mine, please."
half_blood_prince,RON,308,"Aw, bloody hell..."
half_blood_prince,RON,309,Iâ€™d like to leave.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,310,Leave? You canâ€™t be serious.
half_blood_prince,RON,311,That happens to be my sister.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,320,"Be delighted, sir."
half_blood_prince,RON,322,Whatâ€™re you playing at?
half_blood_prince,RON,324,Um... Youâ€™ve got a little...
half_blood_prince,RON,325,Bit worried about her. Did you
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,328,Iâ€™ll get someone --
half_blood_prince,RON,334,"Believe me, Professor, Iâ€™ve been asking myself the same question for six years."
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,335,Is this it?
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,336,I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,339,Indeed. Your evidence?
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,341,"You... just... know. Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the Chosen One."
half_blood_prince,RON,342,What do you suppose Dean sees in
half_blood_prince,RON,347,Skin? Youâ€™re saying Deanâ€™s dating my sister because of her skin?
half_blood_prince,RON,349,"Hermioneâ€™s got nice skin. Wouldnâ€™t you say? As skin goes, I mean."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,360,My parents are dentists. They tend to peopleâ€™s teeth.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,362,"No. Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches."
half_blood_prince,RON,384,So. How was it?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,385,How was what?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,386,Dead boring. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,387,"Olâ€™ Sluggyâ€™s having a Christmas do, you know. And weâ€™re meant to bring someone..."
half_blood_prince,RON,388,I expect youâ€™ll be going with
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,389,"Actually, I was going to ask you."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,391,Really. But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
half_blood_prince,RON,392,Iâ€™m resigning. After todayâ€™s match. McLaggen can have my spot.
half_blood_prince,RON,394,"Sure... As Harry pours, Luna arrives at the table wearing a HAT that bears an uncanny resemblance to a real lion."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,397,"Donâ€™t drink that, Ron! But Ronâ€™s frozen in mid-sip, looking at Harryâ€™s palm too."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,398,You could be expelled for that.
half_blood_prince,RON,400,"Câ€™mon, Harry. Weâ€™ve got a game to win."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,403,"You shouldnâ€™t have done it, Harry."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,405,You didnâ€™t put it in?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,406,Charms spell. Just practicing.
half_blood_prince,RON,408,Whatâ€™s with the birds?
half_blood_prince,RON,411,"Look, I canâ€™t help it if sheâ€™s got"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,426,"Hm? Oh, Iâ€™ve just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac. Under the mistletoe."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,428,I thought it would annoy Ron most.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,429,No thank you.
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,433,Whatâ€™s going on back here?
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,434,"Youâ€™ve just bought yourself a monthâ€™s detention, McLaggen."
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,435,"Not so quick, Potter."
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,437,... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,441,Iâ€™ll escort him out.
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,443,I swore to protect you. I made
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,445,"Youâ€™re afraid, Draco. You attempt to conceal it, but itâ€™s obvious. Let me assist you --"
half_blood_prince,RON,447,Unbreakable Vow. Youâ€™re sure thatâ€™s what Snape said.
half_blood_prince,RON,449,"Itâ€™s just, well, you canâ€™t break an Unbreakable Vow."
half_blood_prince,RON,451,"No, you donâ€™t understand -- Oh, bloody hell..."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,497,"You have to realize who you are, Harry."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,498,So tell me what Arthur said.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,500,What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,502,"He looks different, donâ€™t you think? Draco. Almost... ill."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,505,"Excuse me, I have to go vomit."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,539,Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Olâ€™ Sluggy and ask
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,543,Thatâ€™s... not possible. No one can leave the castle these days.
half_blood_prince,RON,544,"Itâ€™s beautiful, isnâ€™t it? The moon."
half_blood_prince,RON,546,It was on your bed. The box. Thought Iâ€™d try one...
half_blood_prince,RON,548,"I canâ€™t stop thinking about her, Harry."
half_blood_prince,RON,550,She could never annoy me. I think... I think I love her.
half_blood_prince,RON,553,Do you think she knows I exist?
half_blood_prince,RON,554,Snogging? Whoâ€™re you talking about?
half_blood_prince,RON,556,"Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane."
half_blood_prince,RON,559,Itâ€™s no joke! Iâ€™m in love with
half_blood_prince,RON,561,No. Can you introduce me?
half_blood_prince,RON,562,How do I look?
half_blood_prince,RON,570,"Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?"
half_blood_prince,RON,580,What happened to me?
half_blood_prince,RON,583,I feel really... bad.
half_blood_prince,RON,589,"These girls are gonna kill me, Harry."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,598,I might ask you the same.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,600,I happen to be his... friend.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,602,"Heâ€™s been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, Iâ€™ve"
half_blood_prince,RON,604,"Er... My... Nee... Er! My! Nee! Ron, in a haze, reaches out blindly. Blushing, Hermione"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,608,Oh shut up.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,609,Ron. Stop. Youâ€™re making it snow.
half_blood_prince,RON,611,Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,612,"Um, well, she came to visit you in"
half_blood_prince,RON,613,Donâ€™t get me wrong. Iâ€™m bloody
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,614,"Does, doesnâ€™t she? And you say you donâ€™t remember a thing from that night? Not one thing?"
half_blood_prince,RON,615,Well... there is... something.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,617,Thatâ€™s Katie. Thatâ€™s Katie Bell.
half_blood_prince,RON,633,You know. Hide the book.
half_blood_prince,RON,635,"Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,637,Well? How do you feel?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,639,"Now remember. Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,641,"What? No, Harry -- youâ€™ve got to go see Slughorn. We have a plan --"
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,732,Harry. Itâ€™s time.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,734,If one wants it to be. Why?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,736,"Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!"
half_blood_prince,RON,737,No. I got an owl from Dad this * morning. The one at Borgin & Burkeâ€™s? Itâ€™s still there.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,740,What if there are?
half_blood_prince,RON,742,"Good luck, mate."
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,744,Have you ever considered that you ask too much? That you take too much for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I donâ€™t want to do this anymore?
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,836,I gave my word. I made a vow...
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,838,You can no longer stay here.
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,847,Donâ€™t ever associate that word and my name again.
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,849,"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?"
half_blood_prince,SNAPE,850,"You may have gotten your motherâ€™s eyes, but youâ€™re as dim as your father. Yes. Itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m the Half-Blood Prince."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,861,"You donâ€™t honestly think you can * find all those Horcruxes by * yourself, do you? *"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,74,That's rich coming from the owner
prisoner_azkaban,RON,76,Brilliant. It's got loads of old stuff. Mummies. Death masks. Tombs --
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,77,"You know, the ancient Egyptians of"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,78,I also got a new wand.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,80,I haven't shown anyone!
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,102,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny."
prisoner_azkaban,RON,103,I still think it was brilliant.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,105,C'mon. We're in here.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,106,You know everything. How is it
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,107,"Seems to be. Why? What is it, Harry?"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,109,Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,111,"But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean... eventually?"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,112,"Sure -- Of course, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a raving, murderous lunatic..."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,113,Why're we stopping? We can't be there yet...
prisoner_azkaban,RON,114,What's going on?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,116,"Ouch! Ron, that was my foot!"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,117,There's something moving out there. I think... people are coming aboard.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,118,Bloody hell. What's happening?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,120,"Harry? Harry, are you all right?"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,125,"It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black."
prisoner_azkaban,RON,128,"Well, you sort of went... rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something."
prisoner_azkaban,RON,129,No. I felt... weird. Like I'd never be cheerful again. But... no.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,130,I was trembling. Cold. But then... Professor Lupin made it go away...
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,132,"No one was screaming, Harry."
prisoner_azkaban,RON,137,"Good to be home, eh, Harry?"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,140,Where'd you come from?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,141,Me? I've been here all along.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,149,Well. He's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering. But this lot here could be the sun -- that's great happiness. So... he's going to suffer but be very happy about it.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,157,"Death omens. Honestly. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline. Now Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject."
prisoner_azkaban,RON,158,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,159,A fair few.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,160,Hang on. Ancient Runes is the same time as Divination. You'd have to be in two classes at once.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,161,Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
prisoner_azkaban,RON,170,Hagrid. Exactly what is that?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,184,"Hagrid. He's got to be taken to a hospital. I'll go with you, if you like --"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,188,Yes. But I hear Draco's father's furious. I don't think we've heard the end of this...
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,191,Achintee? That's not far from here...
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,198,No one knows.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,199,Boggarts are shape-shifters.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,238,"But, I mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring. Don't you think, Ron?"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,239,Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing. Hang on. I almost forgot. I got you something wicked at Dervish
prisoner_azkaban,RON,240,"If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,242,"Oh, careful of those, they'll make your..."
prisoner_azkaban,RON,244,What's the hold-up? Only Neville ever forgets the password.
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,250,"I've done the dungeons, Headmaster. No sign of Black. Nor anywhere else in the castle."
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,251,"Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own, completely undetected..."
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,252,"You may recall, prior to the start"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,260,"Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever need someone mental."
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,261,Turn to page 394.
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,263,"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say, your Professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time. Page 394."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,265,"But, sir, we've only just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks. We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks --"
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,267,Now. Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,268,No one? How... disappointing.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,269,"Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and responds only to the call of its own kind --"
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,270,"Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must admit to feeling your pain. That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell me. Are you incapable of restraining yourself? Or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?"
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,271,Five points from Gryffindor!
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,272,"Not exactly Picasso, are you? I hope you demonstrate more talent on the Quidditch pitch this weekend then you do as an artist."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,279,Harry! How're you feeling?
prisoner_azkaban,RON,283,You fell off your broom.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,285,"No one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't meant to come on"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,286,"There's something else you should know, Harry. Your Nimbus -- when it blew away? -- it sort of landed"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,318,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,320,Should we move a bit closer?
prisoner_azkaban,RON,321,Huh? Oh... All right...
prisoner_azkaban,RON,322,"Actually, it's fine from here."
prisoner_azkaban,RON,325,"Shut your mouth, Malfoy."
prisoner_azkaban,RON,331,"Bloody hell, Harry! That was not funny!"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,332,Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map!
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,333,But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,334,"Oh, shut up."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,335,That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron
prisoner_azkaban,RON,336,It's not true!
prisoner_azkaban,RON,341,Harry? He's gone.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,383,I don't know how he got in! I was
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,384,That's a lie!
prisoner_azkaban,RON,385,It is not and you bloody well know it!
prisoner_azkaban,RON,388,I find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be in such denial.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,389,Harry. Will you explain to your
prisoner_azkaban,RON,391,"Really? Wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to ribbons! A person could die being your friend, Harry!"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,392,"How'd it go, Hagrid?"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,394,I meant the hearing.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,396,"You mustn't blame yourself, Hagrid."
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,401,Potter. What're you doing wandering the corridors at night?
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,403,"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. Strutting about the castle --"
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,405,Turn out your pockets.
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,406,Turn out your pockets!
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,413,"Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?"
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,415,"That remains to be seen. I've just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. This is supposed to be your area of expertise."
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,416,"Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,424,Here we go again. It's the Grim! It's the Grim!
prisoner_azkaban,RON,427,"She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental, but now it's out in the open for everyone to see..."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,432,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,436,You... foul... loathsome... evil... little cockroach...
prisoner_azkaban,RON,437,Hermione! No!
prisoner_azkaban,RON,438,He's not worth it.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,439,That felt good.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,442,"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid."
prisoner_azkaban,RON,448,I'm not kissing Fang if that's what you're thinking...
prisoner_azkaban,RON,449,Scabbers! You're alive!
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,451,I think you owe someone an apology.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,452,Right. Next time I see
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,453,I meant me.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,460,"Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,461,Ron! No!
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,462,Harry. You do realize what tree this is...
prisoner_azkaban,RON,463,Now behave yourself.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,467,I've got you --
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,477,Where do you suppose this goes?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,479,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,481,Ron! You're okay --
prisoner_azkaban,RON,482,"It's a trap, Harry. He's the dog. He's an Animagus..."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,483,"If you want to kill Harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too!"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,491,No! I trusted you! I covered up for you. And all this time you've
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,493,Since Professor Snape set the essay.
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,513,I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle.
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,515,Give me a reason. I beg you.
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,519,"Witty as ever I see. Tell me, will you be so irreverent when I turn you over to the Dementors?"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,522,Harry. You attacked a teacher.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,525,M-me? It's lunatic...
prisoner_azkaban,RON,527,Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my family for --
prisoner_azkaban,RON,531,What are you going to do to him?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,547,Don't worry. He's under the Somnambulist Charm. It's primarily used to transport the seriously deranged.
prisoner_azkaban,SNAPE,562,Out of the way! ... and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce. Leaping
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,574,"Listen, Harry. They've captured Sirius. Any minute the Dementors are going to perform the Kiss."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,575,It's what Dementors do to those
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,577,No. It's worse. Much worse. You go on living. But you have no memory. No sense of self. You're just a shall. An empty shell...
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,578,Headmaster! You've got to stop
prisoner_azkaban,RON,580,It's Scabbers who did it!
prisoner_azkaban,RON,582,"My rat, sir. Only he's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. You see, he used to be my brother Percy's --"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,587,What in bloody hell was all that about?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,588,"Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you can't walk..."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,591,Seven-thirty. Where were we at seven-thirty?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,593,Come on! We can't be seen!
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,596,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,598,Yes. Dumbledore wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly something happened he wants us to change.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,599,Hurry! Malfoy's coming!
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,606,"No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise,"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,608,"No, Harry! You can't!"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,610,Yes! You Must!
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,611,Fudge is coming and... we're not leaving... why aren't we leaving?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,615,C'mon. Any minute now we're going to be coming out the back door.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,616,Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,621,"Here, Beaky... Come and get the nice dead ferret... yum yum..."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,631,We save Sirius.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,633,Look. It's Lupin.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,635,Here comes Snape.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,636,Now we wait.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,637,'Least someone's enjoying himself.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,641,With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore when we were taken to the hospital. According
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,644,"But, Harry, your Dad's..."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,646,Here we come.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,650,It's happened. Lupin's transformed.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,653,Saving your life.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,657,Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night...
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,660,This is horrible...
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,662,"No one's coming, Harry..."
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,663,"No one's coming! You're dying, both of you... and no one's coming!"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,668,Out of the way!
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,669,Didn't really expect that to work.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,670,Dunamis! Liberare! Annihilare! Emancipare! No. No. No. No.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,672,Quiet! I'm trying to think.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,683,We have to go.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,688,How'd you two get over there? I was just talking to you... over there.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,689,"What d'you think, Harry? Too much"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,708,"Stand back, I said! I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle!"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,714,It's a mystery. Though... this fell out of the wrapping.
phoenix,HERMIONE,52,Are you all right? We overheard
phoenix,HERMIONE,53,--and this hearing at the Ministry--it's just outrageous!
phoenix,HERMIONE,56,...of the Order of the Phoenix. It's a secret society; Dumbledore
phoenix,RON,58,"We wanted to write mate, really we did--only--"
phoenix,HERMIONE,60,Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything.
phoenix,RON,144,"It's only Malfoy, Harry. What'd you expect...?"
phoenix,HERMIONE,150,"Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself--like always."
phoenix,HERMIONE,154,What an interesting necklace.
phoenix,HERMIONE,159,You know her?
phoenix,RON,167,Illuminating? What a load of waffle!
phoenix,HERMIONE,168,There was important stuff hidden in that waffle.
phoenix,HERMIONE,170,It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.
phoenix,RON,181,"As a matter of fact, I do! So unless you want a fistful of Weasley you'll shut your mouth!"
phoenix,RON,182,You all right?
phoenix,RON,184,"Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then."
phoenix,HERMIONE,188,There's nothing in here about actually using defensive spells.
phoenix,HERMIONE,189,But surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts--
phoenix,SNAPE,223,I suggest you ask him.
phoenix,RON,241,"...I'm not asking you to write all of it for me, just...most of it."
phoenix,HERMIONE,242,All right; I'll do the introduction--but that's all.
phoenix,HERMIONE,243,I'll know you're back to normal.
phoenix,HERMIONE,244,What's wrong with your hand?
phoenix,HERMIONE,245,You've got to tell Dumbledore.
phoenix,RON,246,"Bloody hell Harry, the woman's torturing you! If the parents knew about this--!"
phoenix,HERMIONE,248,Harry...You've got to report this. It's a simple matter of--
phoenix,HERMIONE,252,Then help us to.
phoenix,HERMIONE,263,Don't you ever stop eating?
phoenix,RON,264,Wha'? Ah'm 'ungry...
phoenix,HERMIONE,285,"That foul, evil old gargoyle! We've got to do something!"
phoenix,HERMIONE,286,"THAT'S NOT THE POINT, RON! We're not learning how to defend ourselves, we're not learning what we need to pass our OWLS, she's taking over the entire school-- what's Dumbledore playing at?"
phoenix,HERMIONE,296,We've got to be able to defend ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how...
phoenix,RON,298,Look on the bright side--you can't be any worse than old toad-face.
phoenix,RON,299,"I'm here for you, mate."
phoenix,HERMIONE,301,I thought it'd be safer someplace off the beaten track.
phoenix,HERMIONE,303,"Oh, just a couple of people..."
phoenix,HERMIONE,304,"Um--hi. So, you all know why we're here. We need a teacher--a proper teacher, one who's had real experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts--"
phoenix,RON,306,"Why? Because You-Know-Who is back, you tosspot!"
phoenix,HERMIONE,307,So Dumbledore says--
phoenix,HERMIONE,311,Yes. I've seen it. A fully-formed stag Patronus.
phoenix,HERMIONE,318,You're right Harry. We don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're to have any chance of beating V-Voldemort...
phoenix,RON,321,Not bloody likely.
phoenix,RON,323,"Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger?"
phoenix,HERMIONE,327,"You've done it, Neville! You've found the Room of Requirement!"
phoenix,HERMIONE,328,I've heard rumors about it for ages but I never believed them until now...!
phoenix,RON,329,"So, say you really needed a toilet...?"
phoenix,HERMIONE,330,"Charming, Ronald. But yes, that's"
phoenix,HERMIONE,340,No need to think's more like it.
phoenix,RON,346,Don't worry--I'll go easy on you.
phoenix,RON,347,"I--I let her do that. I mean it's just good manners, isn't it!"
phoenix,RON,364,Well? How was it?
phoenix,HERMIONE,366,I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half
phoenix,RON,367,You'd think a bit of snogging
phoenix,HERMIONE,368,"Well obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric, and therefore confused about liking Harry and"
phoenix,RON,369,"One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode!"
phoenix,HERMIONE,370,Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon...
phoenix,SNAPE,377,"You wished to see me, Headmaster?"
phoenix,SNAPE,379,It would appear there is a connection between the Dark Lord's
phoenix,SNAPE,381,Read it. Control it. Unhinge it... In the past it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the
phoenix,HERMIONE,394,Harry? Time to go.
phoenix,HERMIONE,405,"Oh Hagrid, what happened?"
phoenix,RON,407,Nothing? Would you say that if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?
phoenix,RON,442,...you did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
phoenix,HERMIONE,443,"He's right. Not even Dumbledore saw this coming. Besides, if it's anyone's fault it's ours..."
phoenix,RON,444,"Yeah, we talked you into it."
phoenix,RON,450,Any idea where he's taking us?
phoenix,HERMIONE,452,What is that?
phoenix,RON,453,Whatever it is...it's not a happy sound.
phoenix,RON,457,Harry...that hill. It's breathing.
phoenix,HERMIONE,458,Oh Hagrid...you didn't.
phoenix,RON,470,"HAGRID, DO SOMETHING!"
phoenix,HERMIONE,472,Grawp. GRAWP. Listen. Carefully: Put. Me. DOWN.
phoenix,RON,473,Are you all right?
phoenix,HERMIONE,474,Just needs a firm hand is all.
phoenix,RON,476,You just stay away from her.
phoenix,SNAPE,479,Not to me--and not to the Dark Lord if you don't improve! Every
phoenix,SNAPE,483,"Then prove it. Control your emotions, discipline your mind! Legilimens--!"
phoenix,SNAPE,485,I may vomit.
phoenix,SNAPE,487,Is this what you call control?
phoenix,SNAPE,490,YOUR FATHER WAS A SWINE--
phoenix,SNAPE,503,Your lessons are at an end.
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,516,Oh I will. But first you will fetch it for me. CRUCIO!
phoenix,HERMIONE,517,"Harry, are you sure?"
phoenix,HERMIONE,519,"Harry, please, just listen. What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? What if he's only hurting"
phoenix,RON,520,What do we do.
phoenix,RON,522,Are you mental? We're going with you!
phoenix,HERMIONE,524,"When are you going to get it through your head, Harry--we're in this together!"
phoenix,SNAPE,529,I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students; the last of it on Miss Chang...
phoenix,HERMIONE,538,"Well if you won't tell her where it is, I will! It's not worth another student dying!"
phoenix,HERMIONE,540,Dumbledore's secret weapon.
phoenix,HERMIONE,542,Not far. It had to be somewhere students weren't going to find it accidentally.
phoenix,HERMIONE,552,STOP IT! STOP!
phoenix,HERMIONE,563,"Thank you, Grawp."
phoenix,HERMIONE,565,How did you get away?
phoenix,RON,566,Told 'em I was hungry and wanted
phoenix,RON,570,"Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate."
phoenix,HERMIONE,579,What if Voldemort learned about
phoenix,HERMIONE,599,Ron--!
phoenix,RON,601,Better keep running.
phoenix,RON,607,Department of Mysteries... Got
phoenix,HERMIONE,608,"There aren't any voices, Harry. Let's get out of here--"
phoenix,HERMIONE,610,"It's just an empty archway! Please Harry, they'll be here any--"
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,639,Don't speak to me. Or can you restore my broken Prophecy?
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,640,You know the spell. Do it--
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,641,"You're too late, old man. The boy knows the truth."
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,642,That you've been lied too... betrayed...just as I once was.
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,643,"NO. Because he ""loved"" you."
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,644,"Why did your mother and father die? Why will your friends die, when"
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,647,"Yes. By which time I shall be gone, and you dead--"
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,649,suddenly inhales deeply--focuses intently--
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,651,LOOK AT ME!
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,659,"You are a fool, Harry Potter..."
phoenix,VOLDEMORT,660,And you will lose everything.
phoenix,RON,670,Feast's about to start.
phoenix,RON,672,You know...I'm not really that hungry. I could...
phoenix,HERMIONE,682,"What's that, Harry?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,190,Mind? Everywhere else is full.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,192,"I’m Ron, by the way."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,197,"Huh? Oh. I think so. Well, Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant. But we never talk about him. I heard you went to live with"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,198,"Five. I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others. But if I do, it's no big deal because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes. Charlie's old wand. Even Scabbers used to be Percy's..."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,199,"Hardly ever wakes up. He's useless basically. Percy got an owl for making Prefect, but Mum and Dad couldn't afford-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,203,That's rotten luck. They've only
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,205,"I've about six of him. Trade you Scabbers though, if you get Agrippa or Ptolemy."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,206,"Thought he'd be older, did you?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,208,"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,210,"Pathetic, isn't it? Fred gave me a"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,211,Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,212,"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. Scabbers SNORTS, but otherwise remains fat, grey, and asleep."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,213,"Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example..."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,214,"Goodness. You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I know all about you, of course. I was doing a little recreational reading and you're in Modern Magical History, The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the 20th Century."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,216,Didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,217,"There. That's better, isn't it? I'm Hermione Granger, by the way. And you are...?"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,219,35. Pleasure. Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I'm hoping for Gryffindor--I hear Dumbledore himself was in it--but I think I
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,226,"Some kind of test, I think. Fred says it hurts like hell, but I'm sure he was joking. At least...I"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,231,"Well, he's rather disagreeable,"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,233,"38. It's not real, the ceiling. It's only bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,235,I hear he's a genius.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,238,"Oh dear. Here it is, isn't it? The moment. Goodness. What if the hat says nothing and we're all just left standing here forever"

sorcerer_s_stone,RON,245,Harry? What is it?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,260,42. I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,273,"This is Staircase Twelve North, which should take us to Backward Staircase Seven—no wait a minute, we're on Backward Staircase Seven"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,275,"One hundred forty-two, though, in A History of Magic, Bathilda Bagshot makes unattributed reference to three others."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,276,I hate her.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,277,"Whew! We made it, mate. Can you imagine old McGonagall's face if we were late first day out..."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,278,That was bloody brilliant!
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,283,"There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few..."
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,284,Mr. Potter. Our hew...celebrity. Tell me. What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,285,"You don't know. Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?"
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,287,And the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,289,"Pity. Clearly fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter."
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,291,"Silence! And put your hand down, you silly girl!"
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,292,"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is know as the Draught of the Living Dead. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As"
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,293,And Gryffindors. Note that five points will be taken from your House for your classmate's cheek.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,296,Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday before it...
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,297,Hey look! Neville's gotten a Remembrall!
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,298,I've read about those. If the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten something.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,301,It’s mad. Dad says there are dragons guarding some of the vaults.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,318,Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know how to...fly.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,326,Seeker! But first years never make the House teams. You must be the youngest Quidditch player in--
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,331,"Oh go on, Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game there is. And you'll be great too."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,333,You won't make a fool of yourself.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,334,It's in your blood.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,335,Harry...you didn't tell me your
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,337,"I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,339,Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,340,We're not supposed to be here. This is the Third Floor. It's forbidden.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,341,Because Dumbledore said so. Let's go.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,342,That's it. We're done for.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,343,"55. Oh, move over. Alohomora!"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,344,Standard Book of Spells. Chapter Seven.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,346,Shhh! Filch is...gone.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,347,It was locked.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,349,"56. You don't use yqur eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,350,I wasn't looking at its feet. I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,351,"It was standing on a trapdoor, which means-it's not there by accident. It's..."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,353,"That's right. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'll go to bed before either of you figures out another clever way to get us killed. Or worse...expelled."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,368,"Honestly. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-ohhhh- sa. Not Levi-o-saaaah."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,369,"You do it then, if you're so clever."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,373,"It'sLevi-ohhhhh-sa. Not Levi-o- saaaah. She's a nightmare,"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,385,Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably Peeves' playing jokes...
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,387,Smells like Fred's socks. Only...worse.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,391,"Don't worry, Hermione! We're here!"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,392,I heard that!
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,393,What do we do?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,396,"Wingardium LEVI-OHHHH-SA! With that, the club quivers upon the floor...begins to rise."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,399,"No need to kill it, after all."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,402,"It's my fault, Professor McGonagall."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,404,I went looking for the troll. I've read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,407,"Mind you, we did save her from a full grown mountain troll."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,409,What are friends for?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,410,"Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,411,"Ron's right, Harry. You're going to need your strength today."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,414,I tell you what's disturbing. Snape smiling.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,418,But why would anyone go near that dog?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,420,So you're saying...
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,422,But what's safer than Gringotts?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,424,"Well, whatever it is, it must be really valuable."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,426,"Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,429,"That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,443,Maybe something happened to it when
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,445,Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,446,Leave it to me.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,452,"Come on, Hermione..."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,459,That thing has a name?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,465,"Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid. I've"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,470,Queen to pawn six.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,471,Oh my god! That's barbaric!
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,472,That's chess. I see you're packed.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,473,I see you're not.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,474,Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,475,You can help Harry then. He promised to keep looking in the library for Nicolas Flamel over holiday.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,476,We have looked. A hundred times.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,477,I think we've had a bad influence
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,478,"Happy Christmas, Harry!"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,480,"What'd you expect? In your hand's from Hagrid. And by the looks of that lumpy one, Mum's sent you a Weasley sweater."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,483,"Well, let's see then. Put it on. As Harry takes the cloth, we hang on Ron, watching, then:"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,485,"75. Harry, do you know what this is? It’s an invisibility cloak. They're really rare. Who gave you this?"
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,488,"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s, yet?"
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,490,"You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrel."
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,492,You know perfectly well what I mean. Your little bit of hocus pocus...
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,493,"We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decide where your loyalties lie."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,502,"Me. Only I'm...Head Boy! And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup and...bloody hell...I'm Quidditch Captain too! Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,503,Want to play chess?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,505,Want to go visit Hagrid?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,507,"Harry, I know what you're thinking. But don't. There's something not right about that mirror."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,516,I'll ask you again. What are the three most Crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,517,And I'll tell you again. I forgot.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,518,"And what, may I ask, do you plan to do should you get that question on final exams?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,519,Crib off you.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,520,"You will not. Besides, according to"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,521,You’ve got to start standing up to
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,526,"All right then, Neville, who shall it be? Me, Hermione, or..."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,527,He's bowling. So what? He's always bowling.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,528,'Dumbledore is particularly famous
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,532,How could I be so stupid! I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,533,This is light?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,534,Of course! Here it is!
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,535,"Oh, honestly, don't you two read?"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,537,It means you'll never die.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,538,I know what it means—
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,539,"’The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,541,Teaches at Hogwarts.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,542,So Snape wants piles of gold and to live forever. Who wouldn't?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,544,"I don't want to scare you, Harry. It's just...if all Snape wants is"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,553,"Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments..."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,557,I know what that is! But Hagrid. How did you ever get one?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,559,Is that...a dragon?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,560,That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,565,"But it's crazy. And worse, Malfoy, knows."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,570,I just meant... in this case...sorry.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,578,"Why bother? Even with Malfoy losing points, Slytherin's a lock for the House Cup. And look. Malfoy knows it."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,581,"Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,583,A baby that breaths fire.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,607,"You mean...You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest!"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,609,"But if he comes back, you don't think he'd try to...kill you? Do you?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,611,And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,612,No. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,613,I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of year exams were frightful. But I found that rather enjoyable. Weren’t you stunned not to be asked about Elfric the Eager?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,614,"I'm stunned my head didn't explode. Alright there, Harry? 94."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,616,It's happened before...
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,634,And with Dumbledore gone...
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,635,Now what would three fine Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on such a lovely day?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,636,We were just...
sorcerer_s_stone,SNAPE,637,"You want to be careful. People will think you're...up to something. Snape eyes Harry, then turns away."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,638,What do we do now?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,640,Trevor! Shh! Go! You shouldn't be here.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,645,To people. Not us.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,646,"Neville. I'm really, really sorry about this."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,647,"You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant. But scary."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,650,That was close.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,651,Sorry. I get hungry when I'm nervous.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,652,Wait a minute. He's...
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,655,Don't be stupid.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,659,The harp...what happened to the—
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,660,Yuck! What's this ruddy stuff—
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,663,"Lucky this plant thing's here, really."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,665,Wo! Twin creepers encircle Harry's chest.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,666,Stop moving! Both of you! This is Devil's Snare! You have to relax.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,668,"I know, Harry. But you must. If you don't, it'll only kill you faster."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,669,Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,670,What are we going to do now!
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,673,"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. Dances in the dark, delights in the damp..."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,674,"It's deadly fun, but will...sulk in the sunl That's it! Light! Devil's Snare hates the light!"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,675,Lucky we didn't panic.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,677,What is that?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,679,Curious. I've never seen birds like these...
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,684,"Well, it was worth a try."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,685,What's wrong with its wing?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,689,"Oh, go on, Harry. If Snape could catch it on that old CleanSweep, you can. It's not for nothing you're the youngest Seeker in a Century."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,690,"Well, this complicates things a bit."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,691,He'll be torn to pieces..
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,692,I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,694,This is no graveyard...
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,695,It's a chessboard. Sure enough.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,696,But what're we to do?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,697,"It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. Excuse me...are we meant to join you?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,699,"All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione— you'll be the Queenside castle. As for me..."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,700,...I'll be a Knight.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,701,What happens now?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,703,"Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do you?"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,705,"Yes, Hermione? I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,708,"107. There's just one problem with that. It's you that has to go on, Harry. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,710,What is it?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,712,No. There has to be another way!
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,713,Do you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone or not!
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,716,"You're a great wizard, Harry Potter! You are, you know!"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,717,"Me! Books. And cleverness. There are more important things— friendship and bravery and—-oh, Harry, be careful!"
sorcerer_s_stone,VOLDEMORT,729,"Yes. You see what I've become. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough...lies in your pocket."
sorcerer_s_stone,VOLDEMORT,730,"Don't be a fool, Harry. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join me...and live."
sorcerer_s_stone,VOLDEMORT,732,"Ah, bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry...would you like to see your mother and father again?"
sorcerer_s_stone,VOLDEMORT,733,"Together, we can bring them back. All I ask...is for something in return."
sorcerer_s_stone,VOLDEMORT,734,"That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just...give me the Stone."
sorcerer_s_stone,VOLDEMORT,737,Fool! Get the Stone!
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,759,All right. You?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,762,D'you think Dumbledore meant for it all to happen? And for you to do it? Sending you your father's cloak and all?
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,763,"Well, if he did—I mean—that's terrible. You could have been killed. Come to think of it, I could've been killed..."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,769,Of course! And now that he's
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,771,You'd think saving the bloody
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,778,Oh my goodness. We've tied Slytherin!
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,781,"Come on now, Harry."
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,787,"Feels strange, doesn' t it? To be going home."
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,2,A Stinging Jinx.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,30,Harry! What’re we going to do? We can’t just leave Hermione alone
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,33,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,37,"We have to do something, Harry!"
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,48,Works for me.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,50,Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,94,Then you’re on our side.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,102,Who put it there? The fake.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,111,"Harry, are you thinking there’s a Horcrux in Bellatrix’s vault?"
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,112,And if we find one? How’re we supposed to destroy it if we’ve given Griphook the sword?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,133,You’re sure it’s hers?
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,136,Can’t I use the other?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,137,You heard Ollivander. It’s Harry’s now.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,138,But I hate that thing -- that’s
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,140,"How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything."
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,142,That’s a bit scary.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,143,"It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --"
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,145,"It’s perfect. Thank you, Fleur."
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,157,What d’you think?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,159,You want to tell me what that is?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,160,You mean he could see you?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,164,Bloody hell... that’s a sight.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,166,"Couldn’t do anything about that bit in the back that’s always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --"
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,167,Never mind. I’m good.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,172,He’s right. I was being stupid.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,177,What do you mean?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,178,"Harry, what do we do? Harry...?"
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,189,What’s that? Up ahead.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,194,You don’t say.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,201,No. It’s not possible...
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,202,Bloody hell. That’s a Welsh Green.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,203,It looks like it’s been down here forever.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,205,It’s been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,206,That’s barbaric. I...
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,211,Look. Hermione crosses to what appears to be the Sword of Gryffindor.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,212,No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,213,"Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?"
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,215,"Ron, your foot!"
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,218,How’re we going to reach it?
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,221,Harry! Behind you!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,227,Foul little git. Least we’ve got Bogrod.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,229,We can’t just stand here! Who’s got an idea?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,230,You’re asking us? You’re the brilliant one.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,231,I’ve got something. But it’s mad.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,233,That’s your idea?
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,235,It doesn’t realize it’s free!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,236,That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,239,I say we jump!
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,242,How is it you --
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,244,"You let him in! Harry, you can’t --"
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,246,Never mind! What did you see?
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,248,You saw it?
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,250,Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,253,Maybe it’s because of the
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,254,They were ready for us.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,255,"No, you’ll give us away."
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,258,Did you get a look at him! For a second I thought it was --
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,259,Harry! I can see you! In here!
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,269,Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,272,Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,273,"Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn’t seem like someone who’s given up, does it?"
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,279,I don’t remember this being on the Marauder’s Map.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,281,"How bad is it, Neville? With"
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,282,They did that to you? But why?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,300,Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what’s a bloody diadem?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,306,"Shut up, Seamus."
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,309,Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,310,I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by rumor.
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,311,Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter’s movements this evening... I invite
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,332,"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn’t really matter if we find the Horcrux."
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,333,Unless we can destroy it.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,334,So we were thinking --
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,335,You were thinking. It’s Ron’s idea. And it’s brilliant.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,336,"You destroyed Tom Riddle’s Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don’t we?"
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,338,Where are you going?
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,370,No. Of course not.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,371,I’ve never got this far before.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,374,I didn’t expect it to be like this.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,375,What did you expect it to be like?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,399,You do it.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,400,"Yes, you can."
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,414,Bloody hell. We’ll never find him on this.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,417,He vanished. Just now. I saw it.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,436,Did you see where it went? The diadem!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,439,RUN! Goyle’s set the bloody place on fire!
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,441,Do we climb!
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,444,C’mon! This way!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,446,"IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!"
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,449,You’re bloody well welcome!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,452,"Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we’re one step closer to ending this."
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,454,I do not need to seek the boy!
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,456,"How do you live with yourself, Lucius?"
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,462,Why doesn’t it work for me?
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,463,"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In"
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,464,No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,465,There is no wand more powerful.
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,468,"You’re a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know."
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,469,"Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?"
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,470,"With you, of course, my Lord."
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,471,My Lord --
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,472,"You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus."
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,473,But only I can live forever...
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,478,You have your mother’s eyes...
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,479,Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,480,Where is everyone?
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,486,No! Don’t kill me!
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,492,Only what I heard. But now... he
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,494,I have asked.
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,498,You said you would keep her safe!
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,501,No one can know. Your word.
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,504,You see what you want to see.
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,506,Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,508,Drink the rest. It will contain
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,510,It will spread.
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,512,Maybe a year.
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,517,You ask too much.
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,521,"So when the time comes, the boy must die."
deathly_hallows_part2,SNAPE,523,You’ve kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You’ve been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,528,Where’ve you been?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,529,"We thought you’d gone to the forest, we thought you might be --"
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,531,Are you mad! No!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,533,Rubbish! You can’t just give
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,534,"What is it, Harry? What is it you know?"
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,537,I’ll go with you. I’ll --
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,557,"I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken."
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,615,I do not require assistance.
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,620,"Behold, Nagini. Our work is done."
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,623,Stupid girl. You cry for that?
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,624,"While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to"
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,626,"Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer"
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,627,Now is the time to declare yourself.
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,631,"Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don’t be shy."
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,632,"Well, I must say, I’d hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?"
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,633,"Who might you be, young man?"
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,635,"Well, welcome, Neville. I’m sure we can find a place for you in our ranks."
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,637,"Now, now, Bellatrix. Let’s not underestimate our young friend."
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,639,"Very well, Neville. I’m sure we’d all be fascinated to hear what you have to say."
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,643,"Well done, Malfoy!"
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,646,Nagini! With me!
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,647,I said LEAVE HER!
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,650,Why do you live!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,657,Hermione!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,659,I need to tell you something!
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,660,I don’t want you to say anything you wouldn’t say if we weren’t about to be killed by a giant snake! It’ll just ruin it!
deathly_hallows_part2,VOLDEMORT,663,It belongs to me! I killed Snape!
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,668,"Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?"
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,669,Can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,670,Something my mum used to say.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,673,But that means...
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,675,What do you reckon we should do with it?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,677,"I’m just saying. That’s the Elder Wand! It’s the most powerful bloody wand in the world! With that, we could, we could --"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,11,What are those?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,14,C’mon. Mum’s got dinner ready.
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,15,Severus. I was beginning to worry you’d lost your way. Come. I’ve saved you a seat.
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,16,"You know our hosts, of course, Severus. Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable. Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence. Are you, Lucius?"
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,18,Are you burdened?
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,20,"You bring news I trust, Severus?"
deathly_hallows_part1,SNAPE,21,It will happen Saturday next. At nightfall.
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,22,And this information comes --
deathly_hallows_part1,SNAPE,23,from the source we discussed.
deathly_hallows_part1,SNAPE,25,This is a false trail. The Auror Office no longer plays any part in
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,26,"Pius, what say you?"
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,28,"Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most"
deathly_hallows_part1,SNAPE,29,"To a safehouse. Likely the home of someone in the Order. I’m told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him. We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who"
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,31,Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,33,"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be"
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,34,"Come now. Surely one of you would like the honor? What about... you, Lucius?"
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,35,I require your wand.
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,36,Do I detect elm?
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,38,And the core?
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,40,My wand? You can’t possibly think I would give you my wand.
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,42,"For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,73,"Never done that before, have we?"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,112,Hey ya -- Well... thanks.
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMONT,131,Then explain this!
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,133,"Perhaps our friend’s loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail."
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMONT,135,"I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake. I won’t be so forgiving next time..."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,137,For you? You think Madeye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,139,And leave Hermione? Are you mad? We wouldn’t last two days without
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,142,"Tonight’s not the night, mate. You’d only be doing him a favor."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,143,Do you think he knows?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,144,"I mean, they’re bits of his soul,"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,145,"What I’m saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,161,Dumbledore? And me? I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,163,"We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,169,Dumbledore left this? For me? Brilliant. Er -- what is it?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,172,"Mum used to read me those! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,173,"Oh, c’mon! Beedle’s stories are famous! Babbity Rabbitty? No...?"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,177,To Harry! It belongs to Harry!
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,181,"Where is your guard, sir?"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,218,Ron! Ron!
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,220,Where are we?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,221,Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad. Just popped into my head. I don’t know why...
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,223,We need to change.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,224,How the ruddy --
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,225,Undetectable Extension Charm.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,226,"You’re amazing, you are."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,227,Always the tone of surprise.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,228,That’ll be the books.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,230,"They were after you, mate. We’d just put everyone in danger going back."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,231,"Ron’s right. Cappuccino, please."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,234,"Too dangerous. If Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, none of"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,237,I’ve had the essentials packed for days. Just in case.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,238,By the way -- these jeans? Not my favorite. Bit tight.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,244,This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,245,"So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn’t you?"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,247,You’re the boss.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,248,You’re the best with spells.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,251,Maybe you still have the Trace on you.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,252,Can’t be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It’s Wizarding law.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,254,"We didn’t celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I -- we’d prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding..."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,257,"We’ve got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,260,What was that about?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,261,"Mad-eye’s doing, I’d guess. In case Snape decided to come snooping."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,263,It’s a spell to reveal human presence.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,266,Ron! I’ve found him!
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,267,"Harry, you can’t just disappear. We thought --"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,268,It’s from your Mum. To Sirius.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,270,"Harry. I can imagine why you’d want to go there, but... I don’t think Bathilda Bagshot is going to"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,272,Regulus Arcturus Black...?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,273,R... A... B.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,275,R.A.B. was Sirius’ brother?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,285,But was it here? Did you ever see it?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,287,"Ron! RON! Reluctantly, Ron releases the elf."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,297,Expelliarmus! Mundungus’ wand soars into the air... into Hermione’s hand.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,303,"You’re a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,307,Stop lying! Hermione begins to move toward Mundungus. Ron reaches
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,308,Piece of advice. Let’s not rehash old times. Got it... mate?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,311,You’ve still got it.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,313,Right. So let’s do it. Who gets * who? *
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,315,"Completely, utterly, without question."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,346,Harry... they’ve seen you. We’ve got to get out of here.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,348,Long story. Nice meeting you.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,351,"Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany.’"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,354,"Unstopper it. Hermione rips open Ron’s shirt, which is soaked in blood."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,355,Just do it!
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,357,We were. We were there. But
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,359,It’s all I feel safe doing.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,360,Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,362,"Protective enchantments. I don’t fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent..."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,364,Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,365,How’re the mushrooms? Seem to be
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,366,Make sure to leave some for Ron.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,367,So where do we go next?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,368,"It scares me a bit, that, thinking it’s a piece of Vol--"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,369,"No, don’t! Don’t say it!"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,370,It’s taboo -- You-Know-Who’s name.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,372,"I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry. Blimey, what’s that smell?"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,373,Not bloody likely. Smells like something Ginny would cook.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,375,Is that it?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,378,I hate it. It’s like he’s here with us.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,385,What’re you doing?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,387,I can put it in my bag --
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,389,"Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn’t bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn’t that bother you?"
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,391,"You wouldn’t be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch? Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you..."
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,393,I believe you...
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,394,I thought it had stopped.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,395,"You can’t let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it. You have to close your mind. It’s too dangerous --"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,397,Tell me. What you saw.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,402,I think he just hopes he doesn’t
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,404,"We’ve all made sacrifices, Harry."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,405,I don’t know. It takes time. I’m doing all I can.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,407,Take it off.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,408,Take it off. Now.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,411,It’s cold. Even though it’s been lying against your skin for days.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,412,We’ll take turns. Okay?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,415,He could smell it. My perfume.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,417,I told you. Ron’s not strong enough to Apparate.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,424,Mum can make food appear out of thin air.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,425,I said leave it.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,428,"Yeah. Brilliant. Only, correct me if I’m wrong... wasn’t that yesterday’s plan? And the day before that? And the day before that? Walk. Sleep. Walk. Sleep."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,430,None of us do.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,431,Wizards were here.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,432,I don’t like this place.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,433,I want to go.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,435,Oh my god...
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,436,I’ll tell you in a minute.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,438,Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor? It’s Goblin made.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,440,You don’t understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,442,"Harry. You already destroyed one Horcrux, right? Tom Riddle’s diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,444,"Don’t you see! In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,446,Exactly! Which means...
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,448,Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,450,"Actually, I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,452,"Yeah, I’m still here. But you two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,454,"Problem? There’s no problem. Not according to you, anyway."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,457,"Yeah, I thought I did too."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,459,"No, I just reckoned after all this time, we’d have actually achieved something. I reckoned you knew what you were doing. I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,461,"Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,462,"Take it off, Ron. Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,464,"Harry, we weren’t --"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,465,"Don’t lie! You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,466,I didn’t! Not like that! Harry -- I didn’t!
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,467,"Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night? Do you! To make sure I don’t hear Ginny’s name or Fred or George or Mum or --"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,469,NO! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE! YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,474,Are you staying? Or coming?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,475,Fine. I get it. I saw you two
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,476,"What? Ron, no -- please --"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,478,It’s a Muggle station.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,481,‘I open at the close?’
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,483,"I don’t know. But look, I’ve found something as well..."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,484,"I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don’t think it is. It isn’t a rune and it’s not in Spellman’s Syllabary either. And it’s been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn’t part of the book."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,486,What d’you mean -- wearing it?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,487,Why would someone have drawn it in a children’s book?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,489,And it’s exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,490,"It’s dangerous, Harry. But I have to admit, recently even I’ve been thinking we might have to go. I think it’s possible something else is hidden there."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,493,Don’t ever let me give you a haircut again.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,494,I still think we should’ve used Polyjuice Potion.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,496,"Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve! Listen..."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,498,Yeah. I think they would.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,501,No. But look.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,502,Did you know he had a sister?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,505,"Ignotus... Hey, Har --"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,508,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,511,Someone’s watching us. By the gate.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,513,I don’t think this is a good idea.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,515,Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,519,"Harry, I’m not sure about this."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,521,"You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,530,"Confringo! As Hermione’s spell caroms off the trembling walls, we"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,531,"Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney,"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,532,"Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,533,You wanted to know who the boy in
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,534,It was in Bathilda’s sitting room.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,537,For a time.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,540,Wizard rule over Muggles.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,544,It was something Dumbledore came up with. He believed wizards were superior and should rule over
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,545,"It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer. Dumbledore was"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,549,"It’s my fault. As we were leaving Godric’s Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I’m sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,551,Maybe we can --
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,554,"He loved you, Harry. I know he loved you."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,560,Are -- you -- mental?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,562,"Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I'd think."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,564,No. I reckoned it was you.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,568,"No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,570,"And we did, didn’t we?"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,572,"What? No. Harry. That thing’s bad for me. I can’t handle it. I’m not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione. It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,573,No. I can’t --
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,584,I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,586,Saving your life.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,588,And just think of it. Only three to go.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,589,Everything all right?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,592,Wo -- hey -- ouch!
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,594,Never mind why he’s got my wand --
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,595,You destroyed it?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,596,And exactly how is it you have the Sword of Gryffindor?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,598,Don’t think this changes anything.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,599,"No, of course not. I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux! Why would that change anything! Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you! To see you doing those things --"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,600,See me doing what things?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,601,What happened out there?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,602,"Look, I wanted to come back the minute I’d left. I just... didn’t know how to find you."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,605,"It doesn’t just turn off lights. I don’t know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I’d given some Snatchers the slip"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,608,"Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of this."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,609,And what may I ask did I say?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,610,My name. Just my name. Like a whisper.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,611,So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,613,"Just knew. On account of Hermione’s voice. And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,614,"I could feel it inside me. It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea. And I knew it would take me where I needed to go."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,615,I’ve always liked it. These flames Hermione makes.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,616,How long you reckon she’ll stay mad at me?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,618,It was true. Every word.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,619,"Bloody hell. I just realized. You need a wand, right?"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,621,"Well, I’ve got one. Here. It’s Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it’ll do. I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,625,What’s going on in there?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,626,We need to talk.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,628,See this? It’s a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature. It’s the mark again.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,629,It keeps cropping up. Here. In Beedle the Bard. In the graveyard in Godric’s Hollow -- what?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,633,But what does it mean?
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,634,"Harry, you don’t have a clue where"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,635,I think Hermione’s right. I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it? Those in favor...
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,636,"Sorry, Harry. Looks like it’s"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,638,I’m always mad at him.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,640,Keep off the dirigible plums.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,647,Aren’t you the one who keeps
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,650,Do you see that?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,651,"Well, yeah, of course. It’s massive, isn’t it?"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,652,No! Don’t go near it!
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,653,It’s an Erumpent horn. It’s a Class B Tradeable Material.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,654,"Yeah, all right..."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,656,"Where is Luna, sir?"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,661,It’s in here.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,663,Granger. Well... all right.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,664,Midnight. Mum always said midnight.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,669,"It’s obvious, isn’t it?"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,670,"You’re supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible. Dead boring if you ask me. But an unbeatable wand!"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,671,Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,672,"Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you’d lead."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,675,There have always been Cloaks --
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,676,Not like Harry’s. I’ve seen a fair few. Dad used to bring home
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,678,You forgot the water.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,679,For the tea.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,681,"No matter, sir. We really ought to be go--"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,688,Ron! Harry! Take my hand!
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,689,That treacherous old bleeder! Is there no one we can trust!
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,690,I’ll do the enchantments.
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,694,"If not you, then who?"
deathly_hallows_part1,VOLDEMORT,696,"Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where to find it! Tell me who possesses it! The name, Grindelwald! The name!"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,698,What’re you saying?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,710,Piss off! Arthur Weasley’s ten times the wizard you are!
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,713,Penelope Clearwater. Half-blood.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,719,A Stinging Jinx.
sorcerer_s_stone_all_characters,DUMBLEDORE,1,"I should have known you'd be here,"
sorcerer_s_stone_all_characters,DUMBLEDORE,5,"I would trust Hagrid with my life, Professor."
sorcerer_s_stone_all_characters,DUMBLEDORE,7,"No problems, I take it, Hagrid?"
sorcerer_s_stone_all_characters,DUMBLEDORE,11,Exactly. It would be enough to turn
sorcerer_s_stone_all_characters,DUMBLEDORE,12,"There, there, Hagrid. It's not eally goodbye, after all."
sorcerer_s_stone_all_characters,DUMBLEDORE,13,"Good luck, Harry Potter."
sorcerer_s_stone_all_characters,DUMBLEDORE,383,"Everyone will please not panic. Prefects, lead your Houses back to the dormitories. Teachers, follow me to the dungeons."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE,194,"I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,196,"Splendid. Now, I suggest we return to the feast. There's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,289,"She's not dead, Argus. She's been Petrified."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,291,But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say.
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,299,Innocent until proven guilty.
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,301,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,368,There's been another attack.
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,369,"It means our students are in great danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was fortunate. If not for this..."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,427,About time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,428,"Fascinating creatures, phoenixes."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,432,HAGRID! I do not think that Harry has attacked anyone.
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,435,"No, Harry. But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me. Anything at all?"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,539,"It's not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,542,"Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I'm afraid."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,544,"Is there something you wish to tell me, Tom?"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,545,Very well then. Hurry along.
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,587,"Good evening, Hagrid."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,590,"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,602,"Calm yourself, Hagrid!"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,757,Ingenious. Simply... ingenious.
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,760,"Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley. No, I think you've endured enough. I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however. And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up. Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing?"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,762,"You two realize, of course, that in the last few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,763,"Therefore, it seems only fitting..."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,764,"Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. We need our gamekeeper back."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,765,"First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something. Am I right?"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,767,"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,769,"Not intentionally, but... yes."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,771,"It's true, Harry. You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes. Resourcefulness. Determination. A certain disregard for the rules. Yet the"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,773,"Exactly. Which makes you very different from Voldemort. It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry. It's our choices."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,775,Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat.
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,778,Yes. When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,780,Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,781,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,798,"Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,799,"Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled. Everyone cheers, save for Hermione."
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,99,--Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,101,I must have missed it. But due to
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,112,"Pardon me, Minister, but as it happens...we can."
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,118,"Oh, I don't think any of us believe"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,120,"That would be disturbing indeed, Madame Undersecretary...which is why I'm confident the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two Dementors were so very far"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,121,Cornelius...I implore you to listen to reason. The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontravert--
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,123,In the matter of Harry Potter: the law plainly states that magic may be used before Muggles in life- threatening situations.
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,125,Clearly--if it has become practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic.
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,157,"...We have two changes in staffing this year. We are pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly- Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures while Professor"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,158,"...We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher--Professor Dolores Umbridge. DUMBLEDORE (O.S.) [I'm sure I'm not alone in saying good luck, Professor...]"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,161,"...As usual, our Caretaker Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you--"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,166,"Thank you Professor Umbridge; that was most...illuminating. As I was saying, Mr. Filch has asked me... 31. DUMBLEDORE (O.S.) [...to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are any number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch's office door. First-years ought to know that the Forest in"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,282,"--you have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however,"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,283,I trust you all have studying to do?
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,371,"...in the dream, were you standing beside the victim, or looking down"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,375,Phineas: I need you to go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,378,"Yes, Severus. I'm afraid we daren't wait even until morning."
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,438,"Ah, I thought we might hit that little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to--what is the phrase? 'Come quietly.' But I'm afraid I have no intention of going to Azkaban."
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,646,"It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,650,Harry! Stay where you are--!
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,653,Don't fight him Harry! You can't
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,657,Harry...it's not how you are alike--it's how you're not.
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,663,Please. Come in?
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,664,Harry...I know how you must be feeling... 135.
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,665,"No, Harry....the fault is mine."
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,666,"Harry...as much as it pains me to disillusion you, I am all too fallible...and this war that has now begun may just as easily be lost as won."
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,667,"I knew it was only a matter of time before Voldemort became aware of the connection between you, and tried to exploit it. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I"
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,103,"Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen..."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,104,"So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic"
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,106,"And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,110,"Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing"
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,113,"Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,115,For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,117,"My dear old friend, thanks for coming."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,123,The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,145,"Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!"
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,146,The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,147,The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,148,The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,149,"Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!"
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,153,Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,155,Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,157,You're absolutely sure?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,160,That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,163,What do you suggest Minerva?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,165,You heard Barty the rules are clear.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,167,"I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?"
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,274,"Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,275,What are you doing here Miss Granger?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,277,Barty. The bag.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,286,Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,463,I want all the judges over here now.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,472,Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,473,"For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been"
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,485,"But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,489,"Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,503,The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,516,"Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,519,Have there been other dreams like this?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,521,"I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply..."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,531,Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,532,On the count of three... ONE...  The cannon goes off.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,584,Tell me what happened!
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,586,"It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,595,Do you know who I am?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,596,Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,597,Are you alright Alastor?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,601,Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,602,We'll get you up in a minute.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,604,Your arm Harry.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,606,"Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,608,Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,609,"I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry."
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,611,Priorium Contatum. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,612,"No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,487,That wasn’t my intention.
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,488,"Stand up, Severus. I haven’t much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,489,Is this about the Prophecy?
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,491,How much did you relay?
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,493,"If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,495,You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,496,"And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,500,"If you loved Lily Evans, Severus. If you truly loved her. Then your way is clear."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,502,My word that I shall never reveal
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,503,"Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,505,Perhaps. Oh. Severus.
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,507,I was... foolish... greedy...
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,509,For the time being?
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,513,"Well, this makes matters much more straightforward."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,514,"Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort’s plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,515,You must agree.
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,516,"Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,518,There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,519,"On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric’s Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,520,There’s a reason Harry can speak
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,522,Yes. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential.
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,524,"But this is touching, Severus. Don’t tell me you’ve grown to care for the boy?"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,526,Lily. After all this time?
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,561,You cannot help.
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,562,"Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,566,"Ah. That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole I think not."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,570,"And that will, I think, have made all the difference. I suspect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate since that night in Godric’s Hollow all those years ago, Harry."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,572,Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,573,"You were the seventh Horcrux,"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,575,"Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess. Dumbledore smiles."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,577,Something beyond either of our help.
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,579,I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,581,King’s Cross! Is that right?
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,583,"You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn’t trust you."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,584,"I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,586,You are the worthy possessor of
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,590,True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,592,That is up to you.
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,594,"Oh yes. We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let’s say, board a train."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,602,‘Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.’
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,603,"I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable both of inflicting injury and remedying it. But I would -- in this case -- amend my original statement to this:"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,605,"I’ve never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,608,"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity"
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,610,"Actually, if I think about it... it doesn’t seem curious at all."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,613,"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,38,I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk. No light could resist it...
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,40,"Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t it? The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I’m afraid now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,42,Indeed. And quite successfully I might add. Most people vomit
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,44,"Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I assume right about now you’re wondering why I’ve brought you here, am I right?"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,45,"Wand out, Harry."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,49,"I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,52,"Ah yes. Introductions. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn. Horace, this is, well, you know who this is."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,53,"So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren’t perhaps expecting someone else, were you?"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,56,"Well, I think it should be put"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,57,"That was fun. May I use the loo? As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,65,Mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,67,"I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable. I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace. You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,70,"You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,71,"I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,73,"You’ll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,75,Both are waiting for you.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,178,"Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,179,"Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight. You have a right to know why."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,180,"Today, of course, the world knows"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,181,"Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed. Pip pip!"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,215,"Good evening, Harry. You got my message, I see. Come, come. Sit."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,216,So. How are you?
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,218,"Enjoying your classes? Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,222,And what of your activities
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,224,I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger. One can’t help but wonder if --
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,226,"Forgive me, Harry, I..."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,227,... I was merely curious.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,228,What you see before you are memories. In this case pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,229,This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him. I’d like you to see it. If you would...
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,231,I am not family. But his name has been known to me since birth.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,234,Perhaps you could give me an example.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,236,"How do you do, Tom."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,239,"As you wish. Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time,"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,241,No. I am a Professor.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,244,Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,245,"It’s a school. A school of... magic. Riddle stays looking, but says nothing."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,246,"You can do things, can’t you, Tom? Things the other children can’t. Riddle eyes Dumbledore intensely, unblinking."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,248,"Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,250,"I’m like you, Tom. Different."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,252,"I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it. Open. It."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,253,"Take it out. As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,254,Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,255,"Why did you want these things, Tom?"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,256,"Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood?"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,258,It is unusual. But not unheard of.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,260,Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time? No. Had I...
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,261,"Over time, while here at Hogwarts,"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,263,"No. I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,517,Confused? I would be surprised if you weren’t.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,519,This is perhaps the most important memory I’ve collected. It’s also
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,520,I suspect he is ashamed of it.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,523,I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you’ve done so.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,525,"You’re the Chosen One, Harry. And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,526,"This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,590,"Quick thinking on your part, Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,593,"This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don’t by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,595,To whom might I ask?
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,605,"Ah, to be young and feel love’s keen sting. Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended. As Dumbledore leads the others past Harry, Harry studies"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,721,"It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley’s life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this --"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,723,Belonged to Voldemort’s mother. It was difficult to find and...
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,725,One destroys Voldemort.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,727,"True. But magic, especially Dark magic..."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,728,... leaves traces.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,730,Yes. And I think... perhaps... I may have found another. But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,731,"Once again, I shall ask too much of you."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,745,"Whether it has or hasn’t is irrelevant. I will not negotiate this with you, Severus. You agreed. There’s nothing more to discuss."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,746,"Harry. You need a shave, my friend."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,747,At times I forget how much you’ve grown. At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,749,"Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,751,"Understand what I’m saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,752,"Should I tell you to run, you will * run."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,753,And should I tell you to abandon * me and save yourself... You will do so. *
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,754,"Your word, Harry."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,756,Take my arm.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,758,Being me has its privileges.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,760,"This is the place. Oh yes, this place has known magic."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,762,"In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,764,"Oh, no, Harry. Your blood is much more precious than mine."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,765,Careful. The water.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,766,It’s there. The only question is how do we get to it?
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,770,"If you would, Harry..."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,772,"Only recreationally. You see, I believe one creates one’s own luck."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,775,Remember... the water.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,777,"Oh yes. Dumbledore steps back, ponders the basin."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,778,It has to be drunk.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,779,"This potion might paralyze me. It might cause me to forget why I’m here. It might create so much pain I beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests, Harry. It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat. Understood?"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,781,"Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,784,Don’t... don’t make me...
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,787,Make it stop... Please... make it stop...
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,789,My fault. It’s all my fault...
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,790,"Too much... I can’t... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,792,"Your word, Harry! Your word!"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,794,KILL ME! IT’S THE ONLY WAY!
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,804,We have to... go.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,806,"I am not worried, Harry. I am with you."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,808,No. Severus... Severus is who I
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,811,Hide yourself below. And do not speak or show yourself without my permission. No matter what.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,812,"Do as I say, Harry."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,814,"Good evening, Draco. What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening? Or is it Summer? Draco stands poised, wand in hand, eyes darting about."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,816,"I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven’t been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,817,"You are not an assassin, Draco."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,819,Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,821,Then I shall make it easy for you.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,822,"Well done, Draco. But I warn you. * Killing is not nearly as easy. *"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,823,You’re not alone. Are you. There are others. How?
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,824,That cabinet has been broken for years.
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,826,Ingenious. Let me guess. It has
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,828,"Say that again, Draco. But aloud this time."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,830,"Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,133,"Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast. I myself am particularly looking forward to"
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,134,"Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Good luck to you, Professor."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,135,"As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to"
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,246,Mr. Filch. Round up the ghosts.
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,248,Dear lady. Who did this to you?
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,249,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you... to the Great Hall."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,253,I do not believe a single
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,254,No... I feel quite confident the castle is safe. And I'm more than willing to let the students return
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,255,It's astonishing what the body can endure when the mind allows itself to rest.
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,583,"I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen- year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,584,"Ah... a shooting star. If ever one was to make a wish, now would be the time. But time, I'm afraid, is precisely our problem..."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,585,"Mysterious thing, time. Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,586,"By the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,627,"I'm quite sure the Minister isn't suggesting that you had anything to do with it, Hagrid. How could you? You've been with us all along."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,629,"Search the skies if you must, Minister. In the meantime, I wouldn't say no to a cup of tea, Hagrid. Or... a large brandy."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,684,"By the way, when in doubt, I always find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck."
