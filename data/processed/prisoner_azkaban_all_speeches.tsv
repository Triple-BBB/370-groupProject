FULL TAN DRAFT	2	February 24, 2003
HARRY	3	Lumos Maxima...
HARRY	4	Lumos Maxima...
HARRY	5	Lumos Maxima... As the blankets blaze, we CUT INSIDE, find a SKINNY BOY with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting
HARRY	6	Lumos... MAXIMA!
AUNT PETUNIA	7	Well, go on. Open it.
AUNT PETUNIA	8	Marge! Welcome! How was the train?
AUNT MARGE	9	Wretched. Ripper got sick.
AUNT PETUNIA	10	Ah. How... unfortunate.
AUNT MARGE	11	I would've left him with the
UNCLE VERNON	12	What is it?
HARRY	13	Nothing. Something for school...
UNCLE VERNON	14	Later perhaps. If you behave.
HARRY	15	I will if she does.
HARRY	16	Yes.
AUNT MARGE	17	Don’t say 'yes' in that ungrateful tone. Damn good of my brother to keep you, if you ask me.
AUNT MARGE	18	Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that my neffy poo? Come and say hello to your Auntie Marge. Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES. Dudley blinks,
UNCLE VERNON	19	Can I tempt you, Marge?
AUNT MARGE	20	Just a small one. A bit more... a bit more... That's the boy.
AUNT MARGE	21	What are you smirking at! Where is it that you send him, Vernon?
UNCLE VERNON	22	St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate institution for hopeless cases. Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who
AUNT MARGE	23	I see. And do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?
AUNT MARGE	24	Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it.
HARRY	25	That's a lie.
AUNT MARGE	26	What did you say?
HARRY	27	My dad wasn't a drunk. POP! The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.
AUNT PETUNIA	28	Oh my goodness! Marge!
AUNT MARGE	29	Not to worry, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.
UNCLE VERNON	30	You go to bed. Now.
AUNT MARGE	31	Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter about the father. In the end it comes down to the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup...
HARRY	32	Shut up! Shut up!
UNCLE VERNON	33	MARGE!
UNCLE VERNON	34	Don't worry! I've got you...
AUNT MARGE	35	Vernon. Don't you dare --
UNCLE VERNON	36	YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER
UNCLE VERNON	37	You're not allowed to do magic out
HARRY	38	Anywhere's better than here.
HARRY	39	Aaaah! GIANT WHEELS bear down. Harry rolls clear -- just as a PREPOSTEROUSLY PURPLE, TRIPLE-DECKER BUS SCREECHES to a halt. GOLD LETTERS glimmer above the windscreen: The Knight Bus. DOORS HISS. Snap back. REVEAL STAN SHUNPIKE, an 18- year-old boy in a WRINKLED CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM. Pasty
HARRY	40	Fell over.
STAN SHUNPIKE	41	Wha' choo fall over for?
HARRY	42	I didn't do it on purpose.
STAN SHUNPIKE	43	Well, come on then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows across the street -- now simply shadows -- and climbs aboard.
DISHEVELED WIZARD	44	Not now... I'm pickling slugs... Behind the wheel, ERNIE, an UNSHAVEN WIZARD in THICK GLASSES, stares straight ahead, armpits stained with sweat. A SHRUNKEN HEAD dangles from the rearview mirror, MUTTERING incessantly through the STITCHES that lace its mouth.
STAN SHUNPIKE	45	Take 'er away, Ern.
SHRUNKEN HEAD	46	Yeah, take it away! BANG! Ernie rockets away and the beds -- as one -- slide six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed nearest, peers up at the CHANDELIER SWAYING directly
STAN SHUNPIKE	47	Wot you say your name was again?
HARRY	48	I didn't. Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once
STAN SHUNPIKE	49	Whereabouts you headin'?
STAN SHUNPIKE	50	Is it now? Get that, Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
SHRUNKEN HEAD	51	Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from
HARRY	52	Isn't this a bit... dangerous?
STAN SHUNPIKE	53	Naah. Haven't had an accident
SHRUNKEN HEAD	54	Heads up! Little old lady at twelve o'clock! Sure enough, directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is crossing the street. Ernie HITS the BRAKES HARD and
HARRY	55	Who is that? That man.
STAN SHUNPIKE	56	Who is that? That's Sirius Black, that is. Don' tell me you ne'er been hearin' o' Sirius Black?
STAN SHUNPIKE	57	Tha's the question, isn't it? He's the firs' that's done it. Gives me the collywobbles thinking he's out there, though, I'll tell you that. Big supporter of You- Know-'Oo, Black was. Reckon you
SHRUNKEN HEAD	58	Hate that.
HARRY	59	This bus. Don't the Muggles ever...
SHRUNKEN HEAD	60	Turn! Turn! Ernie fans the wheel, sending the Knight Bus into a dizzying 360-degree turn. HEADLIGHTS pinwheel past the windows as the bus rides up on two wheels and Harry is sent flying once more. Grabbing fast to the center POLE,
BRAKES.	61	12.
TOM	62	Mr. Potter... at last.
HARRY	63	Hedwig!
TOM	64	Right smart bird you've got there, Mr. Potter. Arrived only minutes before yourself.
CORNELIUS FUDGE	65	I should tell you, Mr. Potter, earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located just south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched
CORNELIUS FUDGE	66	So that's that, and no harm done.
HARRY	67	No thank you. Minister... I don't understand. I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home --
HARRY	68	'The state of things' sir?
CORNELIUS FUDGE	69	We have a killer on the loose.
CORNELIUS FUDGE	70	Hm? Oh, nothing. You're safe, that's what matters. Tomorrow you'll be on your way to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty of having them brought here for you.
CORNELIUS FUDGE	71	By the way, Harry. Whilst you're here it would be best if you didn't... wander. 15 OMITTED 15
PILLOW.	72	Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry POUNCES -- FLUMPH! The BOOK ROARS angrily, muffled beneath the pillow. Harry takes the ROPE, prepares to rebind it.
YOUNG WITCH	73	Housekeeping.
HERMIONE	74	That's rich coming from the owner
HARRY	75	Egypt! What's it like?
RON	76	Brilliant. It's got loads of old stuff. Mummies. Death masks. Tombs --
HERMIONE	77	You know, the ancient Egyptians of
RON	78	I also got a new wand. Just then, a COMMOTION is HEARD. The Weasleys -- PERCY, FRED, GEORGE, GINNY, ARTHUR, and MOLLY -- arrive en masse, laden with purchases from Diagon Alley.
GEORGE	79	Not flashing that clipping about again, are you, Ron?
RON	80	I haven't shown anyone!
FRED	81	No, not a soul. Unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The cook. The bloke that came to fix the toilet. That wizard from Belgium...
MRS. WEASLEY	82	It's good to see you, Harry.
HARRY	83	Good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	84	Harry. I wonder if I might have a word.
FRED	85	George's nose looks positively massive in that photograph.
GINNY	86	That's your nose, Fred.
FRED	87	Bloody hell. 'Tis, isn't it? Take after your side of the family, don't I, Mum?
ARTHUR WEASLEY	88	Harry. There are some within the Ministry who would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to tell you. But I think you need to know the facts. Because you're in danger. Grave danger. Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	89	What do you know of Sirius Black, Harry?
ARTHUR WEASLEY	90	Harry, thirteen years ago, when you stopped... Mr. Weasley hesitates, unable to continue.
HARRY	91	Voldemort...?
HARRY	92	Voldemort...?
ARTHUR WEASLEY	93	Harry, I hate it when you say --
HARRY	94	I know, sorry. Ron hates it too.
HARRY	95	Kill me? Mr. Weasley nods. Nervously.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	96	Harry. I want you to swear that -- whatever you might hear -- you won't go looking for Black.
HARRY	97	Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me? Mr. Weasley nods, then claps Harry on the shoulder.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	98	Just watch yourself, will you, Harry? 24 OMITTED 24 & & 25 25
MRS. WEASLEY	99	Ron!
HARRY	100	I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...
RON	101	Brilliant!
HERMIONE	102	Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
RON	103	I still think it was brilliant. SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! A copy of the The Monster Book of Monsters SCUTTLES CRAB-LIKE down the aisle, pursued by
NEVILLE	104	Hi, Harry. Ron. Hermione.
HERMIONE	105	C'mon. We're in here.
RON	106	You know everything. How is it
HERMIONE	107	Seems to be. Why? What is it, Harry?
HARRY	108	Close the door.
RON	109	Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
HARRY	110	Yes.
HERMIONE	111	But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean... eventually?
RON	112	Sure -- Of course, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a raving, murderous lunatic... Just then, the COMPARTMENT RATTLES. Lanterns flicker.
HERMIONE	113	Why're we stopping? We can't be there yet...
RON	114	What's going on?
HARRY	115	Dunno... Maybe we've broken down?
HERMIONE	116	Ouch! Ron, that was my foot! SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK. Ron, a dark silhouette against the window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window.
RON	117	There's something moving out there. I think... people are coming aboard. Suddenly the CAR SWAYS violently... rights itself. The METAL WINDOW TRIM at Ron's fingertips begins to VIBRATE.
RON	118	Bloody hell. What's happening? SSSSST! A soft CRACKLING fills the car and FLAMES bloom... in the hands of R.J. Lupin. In the SHIVERING
PROFESSOR LUPIN	119	Don't. Move. A HAND -- slimy and scabbed -- a hand of death -- GRIPS
HERMIONE	120	Harry? Harry, are you all right?
HARRY	121	Thanks.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	122	Chocolate. Eat. It'll help.
HARRY	123	What was that -- that thing?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	124	A Dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now.
HERMIONE	125	It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	126	I need to have a word with the driver. Excuse me.
HARRY	127	What happened to me?
RON	128	Well, you sort of went... rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
RON	129	No. I felt... weird. Like I'd never be cheerful again. But... no.
HERMIONE	130	I was trembling. Cold. But then... Professor Lupin made it go away...
HARRY	131	But someone was screaming. A woman.
HERMIONE	132	No one was screaming, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE	133	Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast. I myself am particularly looking forward to
DUMBLEDORE	134	Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Good luck to you, Professor. Amid SCATTERED APPLAUSE, Harry, Ron, Hermione CLAP
DUMBLEDORE	135	As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to
HARRY	136	Fortuna Major.
RON	137	Good to be home, eh, Harry?
HARRY	138	Yeah... As his breath CLOUDS THE GLASS, we gradually...
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	139	... the Sight. Hello. I am
RON	140	Where'd you come from?
HERMIONE	141	Me? I've been here all along.
NEVILLE	142	I... I think so.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	143	I wouldn't be so sure of that.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	144	Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And in late spring, one
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	145	Well then. Shall we? CUT TO: TEACUP - DETAIL - LATER Inside, a CLOUD of TEA LEAVES mutates oddly. Harry, sitting opposite Ron now, frowns at the leaves, consults
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	146	Broaden your minds, my dears. And allow your eyes to see... beyond. Trelawney takes Lavender Brown's cup, peers inside.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	147	A five-leaf clover... You can expect to wake with a horrible rash tomorrow morning, dear.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	148	... would you be so kind as to select one of the blue ones? I'm rather partial to the pink.
RON	149	Well. He's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering. But this lot here could be the sun -- that's great happiness. So... he's going to suffer but be very happy about it.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	150	Ahhh!
PARVATI	151	What is it, Professor? Trelawney regards Harry with a mixture of pity and fear.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	152	My dear boy... You have the Grim.
PARVATI	153	Not the grin, you idiot. The Grim.
DEAN THOMAS	154	But what does it mean, Professor?
LAVENDER	155	'The Grim...'
LAVENDER	156	'Taking the form of a giant spectral dog, it is among the darkest omens in our world. It is an omen... of death.'
HERMIONE	157	Death omens. Honestly. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline. Now Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject.
RON	158	Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?
HERMIONE	159	A fair few.
RON	160	Hang on. Ancient Runes is the same time as Divination. You'd have to be in two classes at once.
HERMIONE	161	Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
HAGRID	162	C'mon now, get a move on! Got a real treat for yeh. Great lesson comin' up. Follow me.
HAGRID	163	Gather 'round. Find yerself a spot. That's it. Now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer books --
HAGRID	164	Crikey. Didn' yeh know? All yeh've got ter do is stroke 'em. Look -- Hagrid takes Hermione's copy, SNAPS the Spellotape binding it. As it begins to BITE, Hagrid calmly runs a forefinger down the book's spine and it... SHIVERS. Falls quietly open. Hagrid glances at the class, looking suddenly unsure.
HAGRID	165	Righ' then. So... so... yeh've got yer books, an' now yeh need
DRACO	166	God, this place is going to the dogs. Wait until my father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
HARRY	167	Listen, you stupid prat -- Eyes WIDENING in fear, Malfoy steps back, points.
DRACO	168	Potter, there's a Dementor behind you.
HAGRID	169	Gee up, there!
RON	170	Hagrid. Exactly what is that?
HAGRID	171	A Hippogriff, o' course. Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know is they're proud. Easily offended, Hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it migh' be
HAGRID	172	Good man, Harry!
HAGRID	173	Tha's it. Easy now... stop! This here's Buckbeak, Harry. Yeh want ter let 'im make the firs' move. It's polite, see? Jus' take step forward, give 'im a bow, and if Buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed
HAGRID	174	Well done, Harry! Go on. Give 'im a pat.
HAGRID	175	Look at that! I reckon he migh' let yeh ride 'im!
HAGRID	176	We'll jus' set yeh behind the wing joint. Mind yeh don' pull
HAGRID	177	Off yeh go! As Buckbeak GALLOPS FORWARD, Harry slides scarily back, giant WINGS unfold, huge and powerful, and -- WHOOSH! --
HAGRID	178	Good work, Harry!
HARRY	179	Brilliant... Professor.
DRACO	180	Give me a go at that thing. If Potter can do it, it must be easy. You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute --
HAGRID	181	Malfoy! No!
DRACO	182	It's killed me! It's killed me!
HAGRID	183	Calm yerself! Yer fine... jus' a scratch... Hagrid looks: a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's limp arm.
HERMIONE	184	Hagrid. He's got to be taken to a hospital. I'll go with you, if you like --
HAGRID	185	No. I'm the teacher. You all... you all just... Class dismissed!
PANSY	186	Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
HARRY	187	At least Hagrid didn't get sacked.
HERMIONE	188	Yes. But I hear Draco's father's furious. I don't think we've heard the end of this...
SEAMUS	189	He's been sighted!
RON	190	Who? But the PHOTOGRAPH on the Prophet's front page provides a chilling answer: Sirius Black. Hermione reads over the shoulders of others. WHISPERS half to herself:
HERMIONE	191	Achintee? That's not far from here...
NEVILLE	192	You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
LAVENDER	193	With the Dementors at every entrance?
LAVENDAR	194	Dementors? He's already slipped
BEM	195	That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	196	Intriguing, yes? Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what's inside?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	197	Very good, Mr. Finnigan. Can anyone tell us what a Boggart looks like?
HERMIONE	198	No one knows.
HERMIONE	199	Boggarts are shape-shifters.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	200	Terrifying, yes. Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a Boggart. Let's practice it now, shall we? Without wands, please... Riddikulus!
STUDENTS	201	Riddikulus!
PROFESSOR LUPIN	202	Good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a Boggart off is... laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Neville, come up here, will you?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	203	What would you say is the thing that frightens you most?
NEVILLE	204	Profter... Snafpt...
PROFESSOR LUPIN	205	Didn't catch that, Neville, sorry.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	206	Hmmm... yes. Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?
NEVILLE	207	Yes, but I don't want the Boggart
PROFESSOR LUPIN	208	It won't. But I want you to
PROFESSOR LUPIN	209	That's fine. We don't need to hear it. If you see it, we will. Now, when I open this wardrobe, Neville, here's what I want you to do... Lupin leans close to Neville, WHISPERS. Neville's eyes POP OPEN in shock. Consider Lupin uncertainly.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	210	You can do this, Neville.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	211	Right then. Wand at the ready. One. Two. Three! SPARKS jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and
PROFESSOR LUPIN	212	Think, Neville. Think!
NEVILLE	213	R-r-riddikulus! CRACK! Snape stumbles in a FLASH OF LIGHT and reappears... in a LONG, LACE-TRIMMED DRESS, TOWERING MOTH-EATEN HAT, and CRIMSON HANDBAG. Instantly, the
PROFESSOR LUPIN	214	Ron! Forward!
RON	215	Riddikulus! CRACK! ROLLER SKATES materialize on the spider's hairy feet and it begins to shuffle crazily in place. Instantly, Ron relaxes as the class' LAUGHTER rings out.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	216	Parvati! As Parvati steps up, the spider SPINS faster and faster, a DIZZYING BLUR, then reappears as a VAMPIRE.
PARVATI	217	Riddikulus! As the vampire WHIPS its cloak across its eyes, we CUT BEHIND... so our POV is of the students. SWISH! The cloak reopens, the class LAUGHS, and we REVERSE again... see that the vampire is now dressed like CARMEN MIRANDA. As it begins to SHIMMY about -- against its will -- the class starts to CLAP.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	218	Mr. Thomas! As Dean steps up, the vampire's undulating body attenuates, its skin darkening with diamond-thatched SCALES becoming... a GIANT COBRA.
DEAN THOMAS	219	Riddikulus!
PROFESSOR LUPIN	220	Next! ... turns, sees Harry step forward expectantly. Concern flickers through Lupin's face. The Jack-In-The-Box pivots on its spring, its face tumbling toward Harry, becoming more sinister, transforming into a...
PROFESSOR LUPIN	221	Here! CRACK! -- the Dementor vanishes and a ROILING MIST appears, which becomes CLOUDS. Something glows within
PROFESSOR LUPIN	222	Riddikulus! POP! The orb deflates like a punctured balloon, WHIZZES crazily about the room, then darts back into the wardrobe. The door SLAMS SHUT and the CLASS CHEERS.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	223	Well done, everyone. I think that's enough excitement for today. As the students exit, chattering loudly, only Harry, subdued, remains behind. At the doorway, Lupin glances
HARRY	224	Yes, Professor, but I thought if you said I could go --
PROFESSOR LUPIN	225	Well, don't feel too bad. I was roundly disappointed the first time I went.
HARRY	226	Really?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	227	No. I was just trying to make you feel better. Honeydukes' sweets
PROFESSOR LUPIN	228	Yes, that too...
HARRY	229	Professor, can I ask you something?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	230	You'd like to know why I stopped you from facing the Boggart.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	231	But clearly... I was wrong.
HARRY	232	I did think of Voldemort first. But then, I remembered that night on the train... and the Dementors...
PROFESSOR LUPIN	233	Well, well. I'm impressed. That suggests that what you fear most
HARRY	234	Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman. Screaming.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	235	Dementors force us to relive the worst memories of our lives. Our
HARRY	236	I think it was my mother. The
PROFESSOR LUPIN	237	I could tell you stories -- and there are many about your parents,
HERMIONE	238	But, I mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring. Don't you think, Ron?
RON	239	Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing. Hang on. I almost forgot. I got you something wicked at Dervish
RON	240	If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up
HARRY	241	I'm glad you had a good time. Really. And thanks for this.
RON	242	Oh, careful of those, they'll make your... On cue, SMOKE CURLS from Harry's ears and nose.
RON	243	Never mind.
RON	244	What's the hold-up? Only Neville ever forgets the password.
GINNY	245	No. You don't understand --
DUMBLEDORE	246	Mr. Filch. Round up the ghosts.
FILCH	247	There'll be no need for ghosts, Professor... Filch extends a crooked finger. High up, near the
DUMBLEDORE	248	Dear lady. Who did this to you?
DUMBLEDORE	249	Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you... to the Great Hall. 58 MONTAGE - SECURING THE CASTLE - NIGHT 58 CLOCK TOWER DOOR: Great GROANING TUMBLERS fall. SPINDLES rotate. CYLINDERS -- one after another -- fire into place. WINDOWS: Iron SPIKES, sharp as razors, rise instantly. 59 OMITTED 59
SNAPE	250	I've done the dungeons, Headmaster. No sign of Black. Nor anywhere else in the castle.
SNAPE	251	Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own, completely undetected...
SNAPE	252	You may recall, prior to the start
DUMBLEDORE	253	I do not believe a single
DUMBLEDORE	254	No... I feel quite confident the castle is safe. And I'm more than willing to let the students return
DUMBLEDORE	255	It's astonishing what the body can endure when the mind allows itself to rest.
SIR CADOGAN	256	Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan! Back, you scurvy braggarts! You rogues!
SEAMUS	257	He's barking mad!
DEAN THOMAS	258	What d'you expect? After what happened to the Fat Lady, none of
SIR CADOGAN	259	Farewell, comrades! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!
RON	260	Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever need someone mental. 64 OMITTED 64
SNAPE	261	Turn to page 394. As the students eye Snape with guarded curiosity, Malfoy finishes SCRAWLING something on a bit of PARCHMENT and
HARRY	262	Excuse me, sir, but... where's
SNAPE	263	That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say, your Professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time. Page 394. Snape waves the MOTH away, blows out a candle and a SLIDE SHOW BEGINS. An ANCIENT WOODCUT of a HORRIFIC BEAST flickers at the front of the room. Ron frowns down at
RON	264	Werewolves?
HERMIONE	265	But, sir, we've only just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks. We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks --
SNAPE	266	Quiet!
SNAPE	267	Now. Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf? As the class stares mutely at a SLIDE of an ATTACKING WEREWOLF, Hermione waiting desperately for someone to respond to Snape's question, the moth flutters by Harry.
SNAPE	268	No one? How... disappointing.
HERMIONE	269	Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and responds only to the call of its own kind -- Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.
SNAPE	270	Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must admit to feeling your pain. That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell me. Are you incapable of restraining yourself? Or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
SNAPE	271	Five points from Gryffindor!
SNAPE	272	Not exactly Picasso, are you? I hope you demonstrate more talent on the Quidditch pitch this weekend then you do as an artist.
HARRY	273	Come on! Faster!
DEMENTORS.	274	A DISTANT WHISTLE weaves into the WIND, rises in pitch, not a whistle at all, but a... SCREAM. A WOMAN'S SCREAM. Harry's eyes flutter, and wisps of SILVERY WHITE LIGHT
HERMIONE	275	No!!!
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.	276	Not a sound. For the longest time. Then... VOICES:
GEORGE	277	Yeah, c'mon, Ron. We'll walk you off the Astronomy Tower and see how you come out looking.
HARRY	278	Probably a right sight better than
HERMIONE	279	Harry! How're you feeling?
HARRY	280	Brilliant.
FRED	281	Gave us a right good scare, mate.
HARRY	282	What happened?
RON	283	You fell off your broom.
HARRY	284	Really? I meant the match. Who won? Silence. Uncomfortable glances.
HERMIONE	285	No one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't meant to come on
RON	286	There's something else you should know, Harry. Your Nimbus -- when it blew away? -- it sort of landed
PROFESSOR LUPIN	287	Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth.
HARRY	288	I'm scared, Professor.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	289	I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
HARRY	290	I need to learn how to fight them. You could teach me, Professor. You made that Dementor on the train go away...
PROFESSOR LUPIN	291	There was only one that night...
HARRY	292	But you made it go away.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	293	Beautiful...
FRED	294	Clever, Harry.
GEORGE	295	But not clever enough.
FRED	296	Besides, we've got a better way.
HARRY	297	What's this rubbish?
GEORGE	298	It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me.
FRED	299	But we've decided your need's greater than ours. George, if you will...
GEORGE	300	I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
HARRY	301	'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
GEORGE	302	Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. We owe them so much.
HARRY	303	Hang on. This is Hogwarts! And that... No. Is that really... Harry points to a small MOVING DOT labeled "Dumbledore."
FRED	304	Dumbledore.
FRED	305	Pacing.
GEORGE	306	Does that a lot.
HARRY	307	You mean, this map shows...
FRED	308	Everyone.
HARRY	309	Everyone?
GEORGE	310	Everyone.
GEORGE	311	What they're doing.
FRED	312	Every minute.
HARRY	313	Brilliant! Where'd you get it?
FRED	314	Nicked it from Filch's office, of course, first year. Now listen. There's seven secret passageways out of the castle. But we'd recommend...
FRED	315	Witch, right. But you best hurry.
HARRY	316	Dissendium? CLICK! The witch's EYE OPENS and the statue pivots, revealing a DARK OPENING in the floor. As Harry
HARRY	317	Mischief managed. 61.
HERMIONE	318	It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
RON	319	Twice.
HERMIONE	320	Should we move a bit closer?
RON	321	Huh? Oh... All right...
RON	322	Actually, it's fine from here.
HERMIONE	323	Perfect. Just then, VOICES ECHO and THREE FIGURES appear over the rise, phantoms in the mist. Malfoy. Crabbe. Goyle. Pike.
DRACO	324	Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your dream home? Seems a bit grand for you, Weasel- Bee. Don't your family all sleep
RON	325	Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
DRACO	326	How dare you speak to me, you filthy, little mud -- SPLAT! Malfoy takes a SNOWBALL to the grill. Splutters:
DRACO	327	Who did that! Malfoy glances about in confusion, when -- SPLAT!
DRACO	328	Well, don't just stand there!
DRACO	329	Wait a minute, there's something out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!!
HERMIONE	330	Harry...? Harry?
RON	331	Bloody hell, Harry! That was not funny!
RON	332	Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map!
HERMIONE	333	But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to
HERMIONE	334	Oh, shut up.
HERMIONE	335	That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron
RON	336	It's not true!
HARRY	337	Shhh.
CORNELIUS FUDGE	338	I trust business is good?
MADAM ROSMERTA	339	It'd be a right sight better if
CORNELIUS FUDGE	340	We have a killer on the loose.
RON	341	Harry? He's gone. FOOTPRINTS track through the snow, into the pub.
MADAM ROSMERTA	342	Come on then. Let's hear it.
MADAM ROSMERTA	343	You-Know-Who. I've heard this rot. It was all over The Daily Prophet back in the day. And I'll say now what I said then: Of all
CORNELIUS FUDGE	344	Ha! Tell that to Peter Pettigrew!
MADAM ROSMERTA	345	I remember him. What's he got to do with it?
MADAM ROSMERTA	346	Harry.
CORNELIUS FUDGE	347	But that's not the worst of it.
MADAM ROSMERTA	348	What could be worse?
DAY	349	... and FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow. HARRY'S POV ENDS.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	350	You're sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic. Well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.
HARRY	351	If Black can fight the Dementors, I need to know how too. Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	352	Very well. The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Ever hear of it?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	353	A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who can conjure one, the Patronus works something like a shield. The Dementor feeds on it instead of
PROFESSOR LUPIN	354	But in order for it to work, you must think of a memory. And not just any. This memory needs to be a very happy one. And powerful.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	355	Got something? Good. Let it fill you up. Lose yourself in it. Then speak the incantation: Expecto Patronum. Without your wand...
HARRY	356	Expecto Patronum...
PROFESSOR LUPIN	357	Right then. Shall we?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	358	Concentrate, Harry. Concentrate...
HARRY	359	Expecto... Patronum...
HARRY	360	Expecto... Expecto...
PROFESSOR LUPIN	361	Here! CRACK! -- the Dementor mutates into a SILVERY WHITE ORB.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	362	Riddikulus!
PROFESSOR LUPIN	363	Quickly.
HARRY	364	That's one nasty Dementor.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	365	Boggart, Harry. The real thing would be much, much worse. Just out of interest, what were you thinking of? What memory did you choose?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	366	That's not good enough, Harry. Not nearly.
HARRY	367	There's another. It's not happy exactly. I mean, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt. But it's... complicated.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	368	Is it strong?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	369	Then let's try it.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	370	Think, Harry, think --
HARRY	371	Just do it! Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness. Opens the packing case. Instantly, the Dementor appears again. A chill fills the air. The hair skates off Harry's scar.
HARRY	372	Expecto Patronum!
PROFESSOR LUPIN	373	Riddikulus! CRACK! The Dementor vanishes. Harry's arm drops.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	374	Well done.
HARRY	375	I think I've had enough. For today. Lupin nods. Watches Harry move to the door.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	376	So you know, Harry: You'd have
HARRY	377	I was thinking of him. And Mum.
HARRY	378	But it's the best I have.
RON	379	Aaaahhhh!
HARRY	380	Everybody out!
HARRY	381	Show yourself. Crash! The water GLASS SHATTERS on the floor and Scabbers darts past Harry's bare feet, chased by Crookshanks. Seizing the moment, the SILHOUETTE grasps
HARRY	382	Ron! Ron! Harry's eyes flash toward the window, when... Ron pokes
RON	383	I don't know how he got in! I was
HERMIONE	384	That's a lie!
RON	385	It is not and you bloody well know it!
NEVILLE	386	I'm afraid so, ma'am.
HARRY	387	I could've killed him.
RON	388	I find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be in such denial.
HERMIONE	389	Harry. Will you explain to your
HARRY	390	No, I won't. Know why? Because I don't care about your stupid rat! I don't care about your stupid cat! I've got few other things on my mind right now!
RON	391	Really? Wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to ribbons! A person could die being your friend, Harry!
HERMIONE	392	How'd it go, Hagrid?
HAGRID	393	Buckbeak liked London.
HERMIONE	394	I meant the hearing.
HAGRID	395	Oh. That. Well, I got up an' said my bit -- You know, how Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff an' as long as yeh treated 'im with respect, he'd treat you the same. Then Lucius Malfoy got up an' said his bit -- you know, how Buckbeak was a deadly dangerous beast that
HERMIONE	396	You mustn't blame yourself, Hagrid.
HAGRID	397	Buckbeak's not going back to the forest...
HARRY	398	I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
SOFTLY.	399	INSERT - MARAUDER'S MAP "Harry Potter" and "Peter Pettigrew" draw closer and closer.
HARRY	400	Mischief managed!
SNAPE	401	Potter. What're you doing wandering the corridors at night?
HARRY	402	I was... I was... sleepwalking... A sneer curdles the corners of Snape's lips.
SNAPE	403	How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. Strutting about the castle --
HARRY	404	My dad didn’t strut. Nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate you lowering your wand.
SNAPE	405	Turn out your pockets.
SNAPE	406	Turn out your pockets! Finally, Harry obliges. Seeing the map, Snape's eyes glitter.
HARRY	407	Spare bit of parchment...
SNAPE	408	Really...
SNAPE	409	Read it.
HARRY	410	'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
SNAPE	411	Go on.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	412	Professor...?
SNAPE	413	Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	414	Harry? You all right?
SNAPE	415	That remains to be seen. I've just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. This is supposed to be your area of expertise. Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions.
SNAPE	416	Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	417	I seriously doubt that, Severus. It looks to me as if it merely insults anyone who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall pursue any hidden qualities it may possess. As you say, it's my area
PROFESSOR LUPIN	418	I don't know how this map came to be in your possession, Harry, but I'm astounded that you didn't turn it in. Did you ever stop to think that this -- in the hands of
PROFESSOR LUPIN	419	Your father didn't set much store
HARRY	420	Professor. Just so you know, I don't think the map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	421	Very well. I'd like you to return to your dormitory now. Oh, and Harry? Don't take any detours. As Harry looks back, Lupin taps the map.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	422	If you do. I'll know. CUT TO:
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	423	Crystal-gazing requires that you clear the Inner Eye. Only then, will you... See. Oh my, what do we have here...?
HERMIONE	424	Here we go again. It's the Grim! It's the Grim!
LAVENDER	425	'In late spring, one of our number will leave us forever!' You knew, Professor! You saw.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	426	On these occasions, I take no joy
RON	427	She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental, but now it's out in the open for everyone to see... Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off. Harry
HARRY	428	S-sorry?
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	429	Tonight, when the clock strikes twelve, the servant shall break
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY	430	So sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?
HARRY	431	No. Nothing. 83.
HERMIONE	432	I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible.
HARRY	433	It just got worse.
AFTERNOON	434	Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurks within a grouping of monolithic menhirs, BINOCULARS in hand, spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch,
DRACO	435	Did you see the big, fat blubbering oaf?! Oh, this is going to be rich. Did I tell you, Father said I can keep the head --
HERMIONE	436	You... foul... loathsome... evil... little cockroach... Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear
RON	437	Hermione! No!
RON	438	He's not worth it.
HERMIONE	439	That felt good.
HAGRID	440	Look at 'em. Loves the smell o' the trees when the wind blows...
HARRY	441	I say we set him free.
HERMIONE	442	We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
HAGRID	443	Yeh will not! Think I wan' yeh seein' a thing like this! No. Yeh'll drink yer tea an' be off. But before yeh do -- I wan' ter see you an' Ron shake hands, Harry.
HAGRID	444	Thin' I haven' seen 'ow it's bin betw'n you two? Go on now...
HAGRID	445	Good. Now then. Ron, I wan' ter see you give Hermione a hug. HERMIONE/RON What!
HAGRID	446	Go on! You two've been at it all year. An' I'm sick o' it. Acutely uncomfortable, Hermione and Ron step forward and perform perhaps the most awkward hug Hogwarts has ever seen.
HAGRID	447	Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most pathetic hug I e'er seen. But yeh did it, an' tha's wha' matters. There's jus' one other thing...
RON	448	I'm not kissing Fang if that's what you're thinking...
RON	449	Scabbers! You're alive!
HAGRID	450	Yeh should keep a closer eye on yer pets, Ron.
HERMIONE	451	I think you owe someone an apology.
RON	452	Right. Next time I see
HERMIONE	453	I meant me.
HAGRID	454	Crikey. Here we go agin... SMASH! A GLASS JAR on the SHELF SHATTERS. As Hermione scoops up a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE, a second STONE bounces off the back of Harry's head.
HARRY	455	Ow! Harry turns, looks out the window.
HARRY	456	Hagrid... Everyone turns. Looks. Dumbledore and Fudge approach.
HAGRID	457	Yeh got to go! It's almost dark. Anyone sees yeh outside the castle it'll be trouble! Big trouble! 'Specially you, Harry -- BANG! BANG! BANG! The door SHAKES. Hagrid stiffens in
HARRY	458	C'mon.
HARRY	459	What?
HERMIONE	460	Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind.
HERMIONE	461	Ron! No! As Ron pelts after Scabbers, Harry and Hermione give chase.
HERMIONE	462	Harry. You do realize what tree this is...
RON	463	Now behave yourself. CAMERA PULLS BACK: Ron is kneeling under the Whomping Willow.
HARRY	464	That's not good.
RON	465	Harry! Run!
RON	466	Aaaahhh!
HERMIONE	467	I've got you -- Hermione pitches herself onto Harry's feet... and the
RON	468	Harry!
HARRY	469	Hold on, Ron! But it's no use. The dog is too powerful. Harry glances around desperately, then finds himself looking directly
HARRY	470	No, Ron...
HARRY	471	Nooooo!!!
HERMIONE	472	Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!
HERMIONE	473	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
HARRY	474	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
HERMIONE	475	Thanks.
HARRY	476	Don't mention it. Lumos. As the tip of Harry's WAND GLOWS, reveals a long, snaking tunnel.
HERMIONE	477	Where do you suppose this goes?
HARRY	478	I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong...
HERMIONE	479	We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
HARRY	480	Nox.
HERMIONE	481	Ron! You're okay --
RON	482	It's a trap, Harry. He's the dog. He's an Animagus...
HERMIONE	483	If you want to kill Harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too!
SIRIUS BLACK	484	No. Only one will die tonight.
HARRY	485	Then it'll be you!
HERMIONE	486	Harry! No! Just then, FOOTSTEPS sound. Black wheels toward the door, edgy. Harry eyes Black, wand hand shaking
SIRIUS BLACK	487	Going to kill me, Harry?
HARRY	488	Yes.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	489	Looking a bit ragged, aren't we, Sirius? Finally the skin reflects
SIRIUS BLACK	490	You'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?
HERMIONE	491	No! I trusted you! I covered up for you. And all this time you've
PROFESSOR LUPIN	492	How long have you known?
HERMIONE	493	Since Professor Snape set the essay.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	494	You're the brightest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.
SIRIUS BLACK	495	Yes, you glow like the sun. And you howl at the moon. Enough talk! He dies. Now. If you won't do it with me, Remus, I'll do it alone.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	496	Wait, Sirius --
SIRIUS BLACK	497	I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban! Trust me, you wouldn't have lasted a week! Lupin eyes Black, then nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	498	All right then. As you wish...
HARRY	499	No!
HARRY	500	You betrayed my parents! You sold
SIRIUS BLACK	501	It's a lie! I never would've betrayed James and Lily!
PROFESSOR LUPIN	502	Harry! You've got to listen --
HARRY	503	Did he listen! When my mother was
SIRIUS BLACK	504	No! I wasn't there! And I'll regret it the rest of my life! Harry's eyes flash to Black's, glittering with pain.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	505	Someone else betrayed your parents, Harry. Someone in this room right now. Someone who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead.
SIRIUS BLACK	506	He's as good as dead.
HARRY	507	What're you talking about? There's nobody here.
SIRIUS BLACK	508	Oh yes there is... Black turns then, to Ron, and CROONS in a cruel sing song:
SIRIUS BLACK	509	Come out, come out, Peter Come out, come out and play...
RON	510	You're mad...
SNAPE	511	Expelliarmus!
PROFESSOR LUPIN	512	Severus --
SNAPE	513	I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle.
SIRIUS BLACK	514	Brilliant! And -- as usual -- dead wrong. Now give us our wands back. Remus and I have a bit of unfinished business to tend to.
SNAPE	515	Give me a reason. I beg you.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	516	Don't be a fool, Severus!
PROFESSOR LUPIN	517	Quiet, Sirius!
SIRIUS BLACK	518	Piss off.
SNAPE	519	Witty as ever I see. Tell me, will you be so irreverent when I turn you over to the Dementors?
SNAPE	520	After you. As the others start to go, Harry glances at the table where Lupin has left Harry's wand. In a flash, it's in
HARRY	521	Expelliarmus!
HERMIONE	522	Harry. You attacked a teacher.
HARRY	523	You said Peter before. Peter who?
PROFESSOR LUPIN	524	I thought so, too. Until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the Map.
RON	525	M-me? It's lunatic...
SIRIUS BLACK	526	Not you, you idiot. Your rat.
RON	527	Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my family for --
RON	528	So what?
SIRIUS BLACK	529	Finger. Dirty coward cut it off
HARRY	530	Show me.
RON	531	What are you going to do to him?
SIRIUS BLACK	532	Together.
PETTIGREW	533	S-Sirius... R-Remus. My old friends. Neither speaks. Pettigrew's small, watery eyes dart
PETTIGREW	534	Harry! Look at you! Y-you look just like your father. Like James. We were the best of friends, he and I --
SIRIUS BLACK	535	Shut up!
PETTIGREW	536	I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord, you have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself what you would have done, Sirius. What would you have done!
SIRIUS BLACK	537	Died! Died rather than betray my friends! And you should have realized, Peter, if Voldemort didn't kill you...
PROFESSOR LUPIN	538	We would.
PETTIGREW	539	No... please... you can't...
PETTIGREW	540	Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely you won't let them...
HARRY	541	No. Pettigrew's lids lift. Lupin and Black turn. Staggered.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	542	Harry, this man...
HARRY	543	I know what he is. But we'll take
PETTIGREW	544	Bless you, boy! Bless you --
HARRY	545	Get off! I said we'd take you to
PETTIGREW	546	Turn me into a maggot. A dung beetle. A Flobberworm! Anything but the Dementors...
HERMIONE	547	Don't worry. He's under the Somnambulist Charm. It's primarily used to transport the seriously deranged. As Harry nods, Pettigrew's pleading eyes find Hermione.
PETTIGREW	548	Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely you won't let them...
SIRIUS BLACK	549	Beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again. Freely.
HARRY	550	I don't reckon my father'd want
SIRIUS BLACK	551	I don't know if you know, Harry, but when you were born, James and Lily made me your guardian...
HARRY	552	I know.
SIRIUS BLACK	553	And, well, I'll understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle, but, so you know, you could --
HARRY	554	Come live with you? When!
SIRIUS BLACK	555	Soon as my name's cleared...
HERMIONE	556	Harry...
SIRIUS BLACK	557	Remus, old friend... did you take your potion tonight?
SIRIUS BLACK	558	Run. All of you. Now.
SIRIUS BLACK	559	You know the man you truly are, Remus. This flesh is only flesh.
HARRY	560	No!
HERMIONE	561	Professor...?
SNAPE	562	Out of the way! ... and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce. Leaping
HARRY	563	Sirius!
HERMIONE	564	Harry!
HARRY	565	NO!!! Desperately, Harry plucks a THICK BRANCH from the ground
HARRY	566	Please, Professor. Stop... It's me. Suddenly... a HOWL pierces the night.
HARRY	567	Sirius!
HARRY	568	Sirius!
HARRY	569	No... No!
HARRY	570	Expecto... Patronum... Harry's Patronus blooms briefly... and dies. Harry's
HARRY	571	I saw my dad.
HERMIONE	572	What...?
HARRY	573	He sent the Dementors away... I
HERMIONE	574	Listen, Harry. They've captured Sirius. Any minute the Dementors are going to perform the Kiss.
HERMIONE	575	It's what Dementors do to those
HARRY	576	You mean, they're going to kill Sirius?
HERMIONE	577	No. It's worse. Much worse. You go on living. But you have no memory. No sense of self. You're just a shall. An empty shell... As Harry reacts, the door opens and Dumbledore enters.
HERMIONE	578	Headmaster! You've got to stop
HARRY	579	It's true, sir. Sirius is innocent --
RON	580	It's Scabbers who did it!
DUMBLEDORE	581	Scabbers...?
RON	582	My rat, sir. Only he's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. You see, he used to be my brother Percy's --
DUMBLEDORE	583	I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen- year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. As Dumbledore turns to the window, a SHOOTING STAR plummets silently through the sky.
DUMBLEDORE	584	Ah... a shooting star. If ever one was to make a wish, now would be the time. But time, I'm afraid, is precisely our problem... On cue, the MIDNIGHT BELL begins to CHIME... DING!... DING!
DUMBLEDORE	585	Mysterious thing, time. Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
DUMBLEDORE	586	By the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.
RON	587	What in bloody hell was all that about? But Hermione doesn’t reply, instead looping the pendant's
HERMIONE	588	Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you can't walk... As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the BELL continues to CHIME -- DING! DING! -- and...
AFTERNOON	589	TIME REVERSES in a dizzying backward blur, as if a tape were being rewound, every moment that occurred in the hospital room flickering by at a dizzying speed while, outside the window, darkness gives way to dusk and the sun "un-sets," returning to its place low on the horizon. At this point, the TIME REVERSAL ends and the room is... Empty. Except for Harry and Hermione. As Hermione unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion.
HARRY	590	What just happened? Where's Ron?
HERMIONE	591	Seven-thirty. Where were we at seven-thirty?
HARRY	592	Huh? Dunno... going to Hagrid's?
HERMIONE	593	Come on! We can't be seen! Hermione grabs Harry's arm, slams through the door. 120 OMITTED 120 thru thru 122 122
HARRY	594	Hermione! Will you please tell me what it is we're doing?!
HARRY	595	But that... that's... us. This is not... normal. INTERCUT BETWEEN BRIDGE AND SUNDIAL GARDEN. Dumbfounded, Harry turns. Hermione holds up the HOURGLASS.
HERMIONE	596	This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
HARRY	597	You mean, we've gone back in time?
HERMIONE	598	Yes. Dumbledore wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly something happened he wants us to change.
HERMIONE	599	Hurry! Malfoy's coming! Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge. Seconds later,
HARRY	600	Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
HARRY	601	Buckbeak? But... how will saving Buckbeak help Sirius?
HERMIONE	602	We'll see.
HERMIONE	603	What?
HARRY	604	Nothing. Harry looks toward the slope, sees Fudge and the others approaching in a CLOUD of CROWS.
HARRY	605	Here they come. I better hurry.
HERMIONE	606	No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise,
HARRY	607	That's Pettigrew --
HERMIONE	608	No, Harry! You can't!
HARRY	609	Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents! You don't expect me to just sit here...
HERMIONE	610	Yes! You Must!
HERMIONE	611	Fudge is coming and... we're not leaving... why aren't we leaving?
HARRY	612	Are you mad?
HARRY	613	That hurt.
HERMIONE	614	Sorry. Crows begin to drop atop the roof. Fudge's party arrives, RAPS on the door.
HERMIONE	615	C'mon. Any minute now we're going to be coming out the back door. Quickly, Hermione and Harry dash into the trees directly behind... just in time to see themselves -- along with
HERMIONE	616	Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
HARRY	617	Shhh!
HERMIONE	618	Now, Harry! As Harry vaults into the patch, the CROWS STIR, CAWING at
HARRY	619	Get away! Harry waves the crow away, yanks hard on Buckbeat's chain.
HARRY	620	C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on... Buckbeak refuses to move.
HERMIONE	621	Here, Beaky... Come and get the nice dead ferret... yum yum...
CORNELIUS FUDGE	622	Let's get this over with, shall we?
CORNELIUS FUDGE	623	But... where is it? I just saw
HAGRID	624	Beaky...
CORNELIUS FUDGE	625	Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's
HAGRID	626	Professor, I swear! I didn't!
DUMBLEDORE	627	I'm quite sure the Minister isn't suggesting that you had anything to do with it, Hagrid. How could you? You've been with us all along.
CORNELIUS FUDGE	628	We should search the grounds --
DUMBLEDORE	629	Search the skies if you must, Minister. In the meantime, I wouldn't say no to a cup of tea, Hagrid. Or... a large brandy.
HARRY	630	Now what?
HERMIONE	631	We save Sirius.
HERMIONE	632	No idea.
HERMIONE	633	Look. It's Lupin. As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence oddly muted at this distance, Lupin takes a stick, pokes a knot on the trunk. Instantly, the Willow calms.
HARRY	634	Wait until Fred and George hear about that one.
HERMIONE	635	Here comes Snape. As Lupin disappears into the gap at the base of the tree,
HERMIONE	636	Now we wait.
HERMIONE	637	'Least someone's enjoying himself.
HARRY	638	Hermione...
HERMIONE	639	Yes?
HARRY	640	Before. Down by the lake. When I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that someone made the Dementors go away...
HERMIONE	641	With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore when we were taken to the hospital. According
HARRY	642	It was my Dad.
HARRY	643	It was my Dad who conjured the Patronus.
HERMIONE	644	But, Harry, your Dad's...
HARRY	645	Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw.
HERMIONE	646	Here we come.
HARRY	647	You see Sirius talking to me? He's asking me to come live with
HERMIONE	648	Really?
HARRY	649	When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursley's. I'm
HERMIONE	650	It's happened. Lupin's transformed.
HARRY	651	Which means Pettigrew is slipping safely into the night. While we just stand here... A FIERCE GROWLING is heard as twin silhouettes -- the DOG
HARRY	652	What are you doing?
HERMIONE	653	Saving your life.
HARRY	654	Thanks. But we have to move.
HERMIONE	655	Why?
HARRY	656	Because that werewolf you just called is running right this way.
HERMIONE	657	Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night... Just then, a CHILL WIND rises...
HARRY	658	Let's go. CUT TO:
MOVING POV	659	Looking UPWARD... THROUGH the trees as the sky wheels by, Dementors streaking IN AND OUT OF VIEW.
HERMIONE	660	This is horrible...
HARRY	661	Don't worry. My Dad will come... Right there... you'll see... he'll come... any minute... he'll conjure the Patronus
HERMIONE	662	No one's coming, Harry...
HERMIONE	663	No one's coming! You're dying, both of you... and no one's coming!
HERMIONE	664	HARRY, NO!
HARRY	665	EXPECTO PATRONUM!
HARRY	666	You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was... me. I saw myself conjuring
HERMIONE	667	No.
HERMIONE	668	Out of the way!
HERMIONE	669	Didn't really expect that to work.
HERMIONE	670	Dunamis! Liberare! Annihilare! Emancipare! No. No. No. No.
SIRIUS BLACK	671	You might try --
HERMIONE	672	Quiet! I'm trying to think.
HERMIONE	673	BOMBARDA! KA-BOOM! The CELL DOOR ROCKETS to the sky.
SIRIUS BLACK	674	That'll do.
SIRIUS BLACK	675	You truly are your father's son, Harry!
SIRIUS BLACK	676	I'll be forever grateful for this. To both of you.
HARRY	677	I want to go with you.
SIRIUS BLACK	678	One day perhaps. For some time... life will be too... unpredictable. Besides, you're meant to be here.
SIRIUS BLACK	679	But promise me something, Harry.
HARRY	680	Anything.
SIRIUS BLACK	681	Trust yourself. No matter the challenges you face -- and I fear
SIRIUS BLACK	682	A shooting star. Make a wish.
HERMIONE	683	We have to go.
DUMBLEDORE	684	By the way, when in doubt, I always find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck. As Dumbledore begins to close the door, Harry and
DUMBLEDORE	685	Well?
HARRY	686	He's free -- Sirius. We... we did it.
DUMBLEDORE	687	Did what?
RON	688	How'd you two get over there? I was just talking to you... over there.
HERMIONE	689	What d'you think, Harry? Too much
HARRY	690	Afraid so. Always been a bit of
PROFESSOR LUPIN	691	Hello, Harry.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	692	Saw you coming.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	693	I've looked worse, believe me.
HARRY	694	You've been sacked.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	695	Resigned, actually.
HARRY	696	Resigned! But why!
PROFESSOR LUPIN	697	It seems that someone has let slip
HARRY	698	Snape.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	699	Whoever. It was bound to get out. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving. Parents will not want a -- someone like me --
HARRY	700	But Dumbledore --
PROFESSOR LUPIN	701	Has already risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me, well... let's just say I'm used to this by now. But before I go, tell me about your Patrons.
HARRY	702	Well. At first I thought it was a horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I think it was --
PROFESSOR LUPIN	703	A stag.
HARRY	704	Yes.
PROFESSOR LUPIN	705	Your father used to transform into
PROFESSOR LUPIN	706	There are stories about him and your mother, you know. Some are even true. But I think it's safe to say, in the
PROFESSOR LUPIN	707	Mischief managed.
RON	708	Stand back, I said! I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle!
NEVILLE	709	Harry! Wherever did you get it!
SEAMUS	710	Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course --
RON	711	Quiet!
HARRY	712	Whose is that?
HARRY	713	But... how? Who?
HERMIONE	714	It's a mystery. Though... this fell out of the wrapping.
HARRY	715	That's a Hippogriff feather --
SEAMUS	716	Go on, Harry.
NEVILLE	717	Yeah. Let's see.
HARRY	718	I don't think it works. I think it's defective. A collective GROAN. Dejected, many of the kids begin to drift toward the castle. Harry calls after.
HARRY	719	Oh, come on now. It's just a broom.
