goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,435,"But sir, the second task is only hours away and..."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,99,"You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream."
goblet_of_fire,HERMIONE,11,Are you alright?
goblet_of_fire,RON,394,Doubt it. He's way too old.
goblet_of_fire,RON,214,You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
goblet_of_fire,RON,210,Who you talking to?
goblet_of_fire,RON,173,"Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend."
half_blood_prince,RON,279,"Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one. Hope Cormacâ€™s not taking it too hard."
half_blood_prince,RON,175,"Oi! Turn around, you lunatic."
half_blood_prince,RON,145,Probably on the platform. Câ€™mon.
half_blood_prince,RON,583,I feel really... bad.
half_blood_prince,RON,113,How much for this?
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,112,These are adorable.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,193,... is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world.
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,362,"No. Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches."
half_blood_prince,HERMIONE,386,Dead boring. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,591,Seven-thirty. Where were we at seven-thirty?
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,631,We save Sirius.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,105,C'mon. We're in here.
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,610,Yes! You Must!
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,285,"No one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't meant to come on"
prisoner_azkaban,HERMIONE,664,"HARRY, NO!"
prisoner_azkaban,RON,452,Right. Next time I see
prisoner_azkaban,RON,468,Harry!
prisoner_azkaban,RON,388,I find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be in such denial.
prisoner_azkaban,RON,322,"Actually, it's fine from here."
phoenix,HERMIONE,244,What's wrong with your hand?
phoenix,HERMIONE,327,"You've done it, Neville! You've found the Room of Requirement!"
phoenix,HERMIONE,443,"He's right. Not even Dumbledore saw this coming. Besides, if it's anyone's fault it's ours..."
phoenix,HERMIONE,252,Then help us to.
phoenix,RON,58,"We wanted to write mate, really we did--only--"
phoenix,RON,298,Look on the bright side--you can't be any worse than old toad-face.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,669,Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax.
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,483,"Well, let's see then. Put it on. As Harry takes the cloth, we hang on Ron, watching, then:"
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,429,"That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand."
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,393,What do we do?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,278,That was bloody brilliant!
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,339,Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?
sorcerer_s_stone,RON,695,It's a chessboard. Sure enough.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,520,"You will not. Besides, according to"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,333,You won't make a fool of yourself.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,298,I've read about those. If the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten something.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,539,"’The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who"
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,318,Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know how to...fly.
sorcerer_s_stone,HERMIONE,534,Of course! Here it is!
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,250,Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,436,Did you see where it went? The diadem!
deathly_hallows_part2,HERMIONE,229,We can’t just stand here! Who’s got an idea?
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,452,"Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we’re one step closer to ending this."
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,48,Works for me.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,414,Bloody hell. We’ll never find him on this.
deathly_hallows_part2,RON,230,You’re asking us? You’re the brilliant one.
chamber_of_secrets,RON,468,Hey... Where's Hermione?
chamber_of_secrets,RON,152,Who says we're driving?
chamber_of_secrets,RON,697,"I'm okay. This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand."
chamber_of_secrets,RON,322,Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling...
chamber_of_secrets,RON,84,"Harry, sir. Harry Potter."
chamber_of_secrets,RON,471,Yeah. That's better.
chamber_of_secrets,RON,237,Can you believe him?
chamber_of_secrets,RON,641,You don't think Lockhart could be
chamber_of_secrets,HERMIONE,454,Did you get it?
chamber_of_secrets,HERMIONE,320,I heard him. But Malfoy? The Heir of Slytherin?
chamber_of_secrets,HERMIONE,253,Ron! Say something!
chamber_of_secrets,HERMIONE,202,"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been"
chamber_of_secrets,HERMIONE,346,"You will be able to, won't you?"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,478,It’s a Muggle station.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,267,"Harry, you can’t just disappear. We thought --"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,432,I don’t like this place.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,287,"Ron! RON! Reluctantly, Ron releases the elf."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,519,"Harry, I’m not sure about this."
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,464,"Harry, we weren’t --"
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,598,Don’t think this changes anything.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,511,Someone’s watching us. By the gate.
deathly_hallows_part1,HERMIONE,367,So where do we go next?
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,457,"Yeah, I thought I did too."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,452,"Yeah, I’m still here. But you two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,273,R... A... B.
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,651,"Well, yeah, of course. It’s massive, isn’t it?"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,372,"I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry. Blimey, what’s that smell?"
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,672,"Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you’d lead."
deathly_hallows_part1,RON,664,Midnight. Mum always said midnight.
sorcerer_s_stone_all_characters,DUMBLEDORE,13,"Good luck, Harry Potter."
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,301,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth"
chamber_of_secrets_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,435,"No, Harry. But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me. Anything at all?"
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,438,"Ah, I thought we might hit that little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to--what is the phrase? 'Come quietly.' But I'm afraid I have no intention of going to Azkaban."
the_order_phoenix,DUMBLEDORE,663,Please. Come in?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,157,You're absolutely sure?
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,147,The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour
goblet_of_fire_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,489,"Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,562,"Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk."
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,518,There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort
deathly_hallows_part2_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,603,"I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable both of inflicting injury and remedying it. But I would -- in this case -- amend my original statement to this:"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,787,Make it stop... Please... make it stop...
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,753,And should I tell you to abandon * me and save yourself... You will do so. *
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,228,What you see before you are memories. In this case pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,784,Don’t... don’t make me...
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,253,"Take it out. As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing"
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,828,"Say that again, Draco. But aloud this time."
half_blood_prince_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,814,"Good evening, Draco. What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening? Or is it Summer? Draco stands poised, wand in hand, eyes darting about."
prisoner_azkaban_all_speeches,DUMBLEDORE,134,"Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Good luck to you, Professor."
