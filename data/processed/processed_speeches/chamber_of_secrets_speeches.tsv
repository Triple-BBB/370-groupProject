HARRY	3	I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon -- At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER.
HARRY	4	Now you've done it.
UNCLE VERNON	5	I warned you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
HARRY	6	She's bored. If I could just let
HARRY	7	But I haven't gotten any messages. From any of my friends. Not one. All summer.
DUDLEY	8	Who'd want to be friends with you?
UNCLE VERNON	9	I should think you'd be more grateful. We raise you since you were a baby, give you food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... purely out of
DUDLEY	10	I thought he got the second bedroom because Mum was afraid he'd turn us into dung beetles if you put him back in the cupboard under the stairs.
AUNT PETUNIA	11	Not yet, popkin. That's for when
UNCLE VERNON	12	Which should be any moment. Now. Let's run through our schedule one more time. Petunia, when the Masons get here, you will be --
AUNT PETUNIA	13	In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.
UNCLE VERNON	14	Good. And Dudley?
DUDLEY	15	I'll be waiting to open the door.
UNCLE VERNON	16	Excellent.
HARRY	17	I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist.
UNCLE VERNON	18	Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. DOORBELL RINGS. Instantly, Uncle Vernon shoves Harry out of the kitchen and into the hallway.
UNCLE VERNON	19	Upstairs! Hurry! 5 OMITTED 5
HARRY	20	What... Who are you?
DOBBY	21	Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf.
HARRY	22	I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.
DOBBY	23	Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands. It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you... it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin.
HARRY	24	Why don't you sit down?
DOBBY	25	S-s-sit down? Suddenly Dobby BURSTS INTO TEARS. LOUD TEARS. Harry panics.
HARRY	26	Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything --
DOBBY	27	Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has
HARRY	28	You can't have met many decent wizards then.
DOBBY	29	Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
UNCLE VERNON	30	Don't mind that. It's just the... cat.
DUDLEY	31	Cat? What cat?
UNCLE VERNON	32	Our cat, tiger.
HARRY	33	Are you... all right?
DOBBY	34	Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
HARRY	35	Your... family?
DOBBY	36	But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn
HARRY	37	Not go back? But... I have to.
DOBBY	38	This is a plot. A plot to make most terrible things happen. If
HARRY	39	What terrible things? Who's
HARRY	40	Okay! I understand. You can't say -- Too late. Dobby grabs the bedside lamp and starts beating himself about the head and YELPING LOUDLY.
MR. MASON	41	Sounds as if that cat of yours has dragged something in with it, Dursley.
UNCLE VERNON	42	Not to worry. I'll sort it out.
HARRY	43	Stop! Stop! FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing. Quickly, Harry grabs
UNCLE VERNON	44	What the devil are you doing up here! You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy!
HARRY	45	See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts. It's
DOBBY	46	Friends who don't even write to
HARRY	47	Well, I expect they've been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me? Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.
HARRY	48	Give me those. Now.
HARRY	49	Dobby... Please... No...
HARRY	50	I can't. Hogwarts is my home.
UNCLE VERNON	51	I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs...
AUNT PETUNIA	52	We have ice cream...
UNCLE VERNON	53	Go on. Read it.
HARRY	54	'Dear Mr. Potter. We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence at twelve minutes past seven this evening. As you know, underage wizards...'
UNCLE VERNON	55	'... are not permitted to perform spells outside school.'
DUDLEY	56	I know what day it is.
HARRY	57	Well done, Dudley. Finally learned the days of the week, have you.
DUDLEY	58	Today's your birthday. And nobody cares. Dudley SNAPS SHUT the flap. Harry sighs, takes the soup
HARRY	59	It's no good turning your beak up. It's all we've got. Harry feeds a piece of bread to Hedwig... as we... DISSOLVE TO:
HARRY	60	Ron?
RON	61	Hiya, Harry.
HARRY	62	Fred? George? What're you doing here?
RON	63	Rescuing you, of course. Where's your trunk? 13B CLOSEUP - HARRY'S TRUNK 13B Stuffed with clothes, spellbooks. The trunk CLOSES, SNAPS SHUT. Harry drags the trunk to the windowsill, watches Ron tie off a fierce knot on the bars of Harry's window.
RON	64	Stand back.
HARRY	65	Hedwig! Harry clambers back, grabs Hedwig's cage, swings it onto
UNCLE VERNON	66	Petunia! He's getting away! As Harry leaps for the windowsill, Uncle Vernon CHARGES
RON	67	Hold on, Harry!
UNCLE VERNON	68	Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere! CLOSE-UP: Harry's hand begins to slip away from Ron's. INSIDE OF CAGE: Hedwig PECKS HARDER and... the CAGE
RON	69	Put your foot down, Fred!
RON	70	By the way, Harry. Happy Birthday. DISSOLVE TO:
FRED	71	Hurry! Let's nip inside before Mum wakes up!
RON	72	It's not much.
HARRY	73	I think it's... brilliant!
MRS. WEASLEY	74	Harry! How wonderful to see you.
RON	75	They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window!
MRS. WEASLEY	76	You best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley!
GINNY	77	Mummy. Have you seen my jumper -- A small, RED-HEADED GIRL appears. Sees Harry. And... SQUEALS. Dashes back up the stairs. Ron frowns.
RON	78	Ginny. Been talking about you all summer. Dead annoying, really.
GEORGE	79	Dad's home!
MR. WEASLEY	80	What a night! Nine raids! Nine!
RON	81	Dad works at the Ministry of Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.
RON	82	That's when wizards bewitch something to drive Muggles mad. Shrinking door keys, that kind of thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks they're fascinating.
MR. WEASLEY	83	Well now. Who are you?
RON	84	Harry, sir. Harry Potter.
MR. WEASLEY	85	Good Lord, are you really? Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did you get here?
MR. WEASLEY	86	Did you now! How'd it go?!
MRS. WEASLEY	87	That must be Errol with the post. Fetch him, will you, George?
GEORGE	88	It's our Hogwarts letters! And look. They've sent Harry's as well.
MRS. WEASLEY	89	We'll manage. Right then. There's only one place to get all of this. HARRY/RON/FRED/GEORGE Diagon Alley! 19A OMITTED 19A thru thru 23 23
MRS. WEASLEY	90	You first, Harry dear.
RON	91	Harry's never traveled by Floo Powder before, Mum.
HARRY	92	Floo Powder? Just then, Ron's older brother PERCY enters.
MRS. WEASLEY	93	Percy. Would you mind going first, so Harry can see how it's done?
PERCY	94	Certainly, Mother. Don't worry, Harry. It's simple enough.
PERCY	95	Diagon Alley. Percy VANISHES. Tentatively, Harry reaches into the pot.
MRS. WEASLEY	96	Remember to speak clearly, dear!
LUCIUS MALFOY	97	I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin. But selling.
MR. BORGIN	98	Selling?
LUCIUS MALFOY	99	You have heard, of course, that
LUCIUS MALFOY	100	I have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if the Ministry were to call. Certain poisons and the like...
MR. BORGIN	101	Hmmm... yes. I see... INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry realizes the walls are CLOSING
DRACO	102	Can I have this?
MR. BORGIN	103	Ah, the Hand of Glory. Insert a candle and it gives light only to
LUCIUS MALFOY	104	Hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, Mr. Borgin.
DRACO	105	It's not my fault the teachers have favorites. That Hermione Granger --
LUCIUS MALFOY	106	I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam.
MR. BORGIN	107	It's the same all over. Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere.
LUCIUS MALFOY	108	Very good. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow. Come, Draco.
SPIDERS.	109	AGED WITCH (O.S.) Not lost are you, my dear?
HARRY	110	I'm fine, thanks. I'm just --
HAGRID	111	HARRY! What d'yer think yer doin' down 'ere?
HARRY	112	Hagrid!
HAGRID	113	Yer a mess! Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley. Dodgy place, Harry. Don't want no one ter see yeh down there. People'll be thinkin' yer up ter no good.
HARRY	114	I was lost, I -- Hang on. What were you doing down there?
HAGRID	115	I was lookin' fer a Flesh Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin'
HERMIONE	116	Hello, Hagrid. Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again.
HERMIONE	117	Oculus Reparo. Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.
HARRY	118	I need to remember that one.
HERMIONE	119	C'mon. Everyone's been so worried.
MR. WEASLEY	120	So you're dentists! Fascinating! I understand other Muggles quite fear you? Why is that?
MRS. WEASLEY	121	Oh, Harry. Thank goodness. We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far. Come now. We're off to Flourish and Blotts.
HERMIONE	122	Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy Lockhart's going to be there! We can actually meet him! I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist! As Mrs. Weasley and Hermione dash off, Harry frowns.
HARRY	123	Who? 29 OMITTED 29
SHORT MAN	124	Out of the way! This is for The Daily Prophet! Instantly, Lockhart looks up, flashes a smile, when...
GILDEROY LOCKHART	125	It can't be Harry Potter?
HARRY	126	Thank you. Slipping free, Harry drifts back into the crowd and, red with embarrassment, drops the books into Ginny's cauldron.
HARRY	127	You have these. I'll buy my own!--
DRACO	128	Look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend!
LUCIUS MALFOY	129	Silence, Draco! Ah... Mr. Potter. I don't believe we've met.
LUCIUS MALFOY	130	Forgive me, Mr. Potter. But your scar is legend. As, of course, is
LUCIUS MALFOY	131	Yes, a pity about your parents. Curious that you yourself should escape with a mere flesh wound. Curious, too, that you speak of him in the past. Surely, you
LUCIUS MALFOY	132	You must be very brave, Mr.
HERMIONE	133	Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
LUCIUS MALFOY	134	You must be Miss Granger. Draco's told me all about you... and your parents. Muggles, aren't you?
MR. WEASLEY	135	Ron! Harry! It's mad in here. Let's go outside.
LUCIUS MALFOY	136	Well, well, well -- Arthur Weasley.
LUCIUS MALFOY	137	Busy time at the Ministry. All those raids. I hope they're paying you overtime. Malfoy reaches into Ginny's cauldron, removes a very old, battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration.
LUCIUS MALFOY	138	Obviously not. Dear me. What's
MR. WEASLEY	139	We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Lucius.
HAGRID	140	Ignore 'im, Arthur.
LUCIUS MALFOY	141	Here, girl. Take your book. It's
HAGRID	142	No Malfoy's worth listenin' ter. Rotten ter the core, the whole family... As Harry watches Draco and his father go, we -- DISSOLVE TO: 30A OMITTED 30A
MRS. WEASLEY	143	Oh dear! The train'll be leaving any moment! All together now!
MRS. WEASLEY	144	Go on, Ginny. You know what to do. Ginny, looking a bit nervous, rushes toward the barrier,
RON	145	We better hurry.
GUARD	146	What in blazes d'you two think you're doing?
HARRY	147	Sorry. Lost control of the trolley.
RON	148	I dunno. The gateway's sealed itself for some reason.
RON	149	Can't hear a thing.
HARRY	150	Maybe we should go wait by the car.
HARRY	151	This is mad. We can't drive to Hogwarts.
RON	152	Who says we're driving?
HARRY	153	You don't mean -- Ron, no.
RON	154	Look, who knows when Mum and Dad will get back. And we've got to get to school, haven't we? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's an absolute emergency. Least that's what Fred
HARRY	155	Something tells me we're going to regret this.
HARRY	156	No offense, Ron, but are you sure you know how to fly this.
RON	157	No problem. Ron SHIFTS. With a GREAT JOLT, the car lifts from the ground.
RON	158	There. See. Now I reckon all we have to do is find the Hogwarts Express and follow it. Simple.
HARRY	159	Uh, Ron. I should tell you. Most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
RON	160	Right. Ron presses a TINY SILVER BUTTON on the dashboard and
RON	161	Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster must be faulty. CAMERA ZOOMS ALONG the ridge of a cliff. The car reappears from above, gliding away FROM CAMERA.
RON	162	Any sign of the train?
HARRY	163	There! Up ahead! Look... Along a STEEP BRIDGE, a single line of TRAIN TRACKS appear.
RON	164	Brilliant. Ron SHIFTS, GLIDES DOWN, until the Anglia is only a few feet above the tracks. The boys peer ahead, looking for
RON	165	It must be around here someplace.
HARRY	166	Do you hear that? Then, at precisely the same moment, Harry and Ron
RON	167	Take my hand! Harry's grips Ron's hand, eyes the train steaming far below. It's quite a drop. Harry's fingers begin to LOSE
RON	168	Hold on!
HARRY	169	I'm trying! Your hand's all sweaty!
HARRY	170	I think we found the train.
RON	171	Welcome home, Harry.
HARRY	172	Just out of interest, Ron. Have you ever landed a car before?
RON	173	Well... no. but, until a few hours ago, I'd never taken off in one either. With that, the car LURCHES, the nose DROPS, and...
RON	174	Uh oh.
RON	175	IT'S NOT WORKING!
HARRY	176	UP! UP!
HARRY	177	MIND THAT TREE! Down below a GIANT WILLOW TREE looms. Ron SHIFTS. Nothing.
HARRY	178	TURN! TURN!
RON	179	STOP! STOP! STOP!
RON	180	My wand! Look at my wand!
HARRY	181	Be thankful it's not your neck. THWUNMP! Something HEAVY HITS Harry's door, sends a SHUDDER through the car.
RON	182	What's happening?
RON	183	What kind of tree is this? Before Harry can respond, the tree begins to PUMMEL THE CAR from all sides, tossing Henry and Ron about like popcorn. WINDOWS SHATTER. Heavy DENTS appear on the roof above Ron and Harry's heads. Then the car FALLS again... ... SLAMMING HEAVILY TO THE GROUND. Instantly, the tree's lower branches shoot through the front and rear windscreens and, gaining purchase, begin to SHAKE THE CAR
BACK AND FORTH.	184	HARRY/RON Aaaaahhhhh!
HARRY	185	Reverse! Reverse!
RON	186	Dad's going to kill me.
HARRY	187	A house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
FILCH	188	Well, take a good look, lads...
FILCH	189	This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.
SNAPE	190	You were seen! By no less then seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that has been on these grounds for hundreds of years.
RON	191	Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
SNAPE	192	Silence! I assure you, were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight. As it is --
SNAPE	193	Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE	194	I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for
RON	195	Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you?
DUMBLEDORE	196	Splendid. Now, I suggest we return to the feast. There's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample. Rising, Harry spies an ENVELOPE on the floor. Taking it,
NEVILLE	197	Detention. On the first day?
SEAMUS	198	That must be some kind of record.
HERMIONE	199	I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got.
RON	200	I should think you'd mind your own business.
PROFESSOR SPROUT	201	Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Today, we will be re-potting Mandrakes. Now, who here can tell me the properties of
HERMIONE	202	Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been
PROFESSOR SPROUT	203	Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are
PROFESSOR SPROUT	204	Hm. Looks as though Mr.
SEAMUS	205	No, ma'am. He's just fainted.
PENELOPE CLEARWATER	206	There's Nearly Headless Nick.
PERCY	207	Hello, Sir Nicolas.
NEARLY HEADLESS NICK	208	Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater.
RON	209	Say it. I'm doomed.
HARRY	210	You're doomed.
COLIN	211	Hiya, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.
HARRY	212	Hello, Colin. Nice to meet --
COLIN	213	They're for my dad -- the pictures. He's a milkman, you know, a Muggle, like all our family's been until me. No one knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till we got my letter from Hogwarts. Everyone just thought I was mental.
RON	214	Imagine that.
COLIN	215	Say, Harry. D'you think your friend could take a photo of me
DEAN THOMAS	216	Post is here! One after another, the birds swoop gracefully down, clutching letters from home. All except one, who plops beak-first into Ron's soup. Errol.
RON	217	Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh... no.
SEAMUS	218	Heads up, everyone. Weasley's gotten himself a Howler.
NEVILLE	219	Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my Gran once... and it was horrible.
HARRY	220	Look at it this way. How much worse can things get? 38.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	221	Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award -- But I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by
GILDEROY LOCKHART	222	I see you've all bought a complete set of my books. Well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about. Just to check how well
RON	223	Look at these questions. They're
HARRY	224	'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color?'
RON	225	'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?'
HARRY	226	'When is Gilderoy Lockhart's
GILDEROY LOCKHART	227	You have thirty minutes. Start -- now! As quills begin to dart across pages, we -- DISSOLVE TO: 39. SAME SCENE - LATER Lockhart rifles through the completed exams.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	228	Tut, tut. Hardly any of you remembered my favorite color is lilac. But Miss Hermione Granger knew that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair care potions. Good girl.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	229	Now... be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here... With a showman's flair, Lockhart turns slowly to the cage.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	230	I must ask you not to scream. It
SEAMUS	231	Cornish pixies?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	232	Freshly caught Cornish pixies. Unable to control himself, Seamus SNORTS with laughter.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	233	Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan, but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them now! Lockhart flings open the cage. Instantly, the pixies rocket about, spraying the students with ink bottles, BREAKING BEAKERS and shredding books. Two SEIZE Neville
GILDEROY LOCKHART	234	I'll ask you three to just nip the
RON	235	What do we do now?
NEVILLE	236	Why is it always me? 42A OMITTED 42A
RON	237	Can you believe him?
HERMIONE	238	I'm sure Professor Lockhart just wanted to give us some hands-on experience.
WOOD	239	I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We're going to train earlier, harder, and longer!
RON	240	Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
WOOD	241	Clear out, Flint! I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
FLINT	242	Easy, Wood. I've got a note. As Wood snatches the PARCHMENT from Flint's hand, Ron and
WOOD	243	'I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today,
HARRY	244	Draco?
DRACO	245	That's right. And that's not all that's new this year... As one, the seven Slytherins hold out seven brand-new GLEAMING BROOMSTICKS. The Gryffindors look stunned.
RON	246	Those are Nimbus Two Thousand Ones.
FLINT	247	A generous gift from Draco's father.
DRACO	248	That's right, Weasley. You see, unlike some, my father can afford to buy the best.
HERMIONE	249	At least no one on the Gryffindor
DRACO	250	No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood. Everyone reacts as if Malfoy has said something horrific -- everyone save Harry, who looks puzzled. Instantly,
WOOD	251	Save it for the match.
RON	252	You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!
HERMIONE	253	Ron! Say something!
COLIN	254	Wow! Can you hold him still, Harry?!
HARRY	255	Get out of the way, Colin!
HAGRID	256	Got jus' the thing. Set 'im down on that chair o'er there.
HERMIONE	257	It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone... like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
HAGRID	258	Yeh see, Harry. There are some wizards -- like Malfoy's family -- who think they're better than everyone else 'cause they're what people call pureblood.
HARRY	259	That's horrible.
HAGRID	260	An' it's codswallop ter boot. Dirty blood. There's 'ardly a wizard today that's not half-blood or less. If we 'adn't married Muggles we'd've died out long ago.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	261	Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me answer my fan mail?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	262	Fame's a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that.
VOICE	263	Come... come to me...
HARRY	264	What?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	265	I was saying, six solid months at
HARRY	266	No... not you, that... voice.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	267	Voice?
HARRY	268	That... voice. Didn't you hear it?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	269	What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit drowsy. Great Scott -- and no wonder -- look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Dinner's nearly done! If you hurry you might make pudding. Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun!
HARRY	270	Spooky.
VOICE	271	Blood... I smell blood...
VOICE	272	Let me rip you... let me kill you...
HERMIONE	273	Harry!
HARRY	274	Did you hear it?
RON	275	Hear what?
HARRY	276	That... voice.
HERMIONE	277	Voice? What voice?
VOICE	278	Kill... Time to kill...
HARRY	279	It's moving. I think it's going to... kill. Harry runs off. Hermione and Ron exchange a glance, follow. 50 OMITTED 50 thru thru 57 57
RON	280	Harry, what are you doing?
HERMIONE	281	'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened...?'
RON	282	What's that? Hanging underneath?
HARRY	283	That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris.
HERMIONE	284	Look at that. Have you ever seen spiders act like that? Ron...?
DRACO	285	Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods! Draco's eyes find Hermione, just as Filch appears.
FILCH	286	What's going on here? Go on now! Make way...
DUMBLEDORE	287	Argus! Dumbledore marches forward, trailed by a phalanx of teachers. Seeing the wall, Dumbledore's face darkens.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	288	It was definitely a curse that
DUMBLEDORE	289	She's not dead, Argus. She's been Petrified.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	290	Precisely! So unlucky I wasn't there. I know the very countercurse that could have
DUMBLEDORE	291	But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say.
HARRY	292	It's not true, sir! I swear! I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don't even know what a Squib is.
FILCH	293	Rubbish! He saw my Kwikspell letter!
SNAPE	294	If I might, Headmaster...
SNAPE	295	However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	296	I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail... As Snape's lip curls in disgust, Hermione leaps in.
HERMIONE	297	That's why Ron and I went looking
HARRY	298	When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the Common Room and... found Mrs. Norris.
DUMBLEDORE	299	Innocent until proven guilty.
FILCH	300	My cat has been Petrified! I want to see some punishment!
DUMBLEDORE	301	We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth
RON	302	A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got
HERMIONE	303	Harry. This voice. You said you heard it first in Lockhart's office?
HARRY	304	Yes.
HERMIONE	305	I hardly think someone with
HARRY	306	You do believe me, don't you?
HERMIONE	307	'Course we do. It's just... it's a bit weird, isn't it? You hear this voice and then... Mrs. Norris
HARRY	308	I can't explain it -- it was... scary.
RON	309	Are you mad!
HERMIONE	310	No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. 61 OMITTED 61
HERMIONE	311	Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets? A HUSH falls over the class.
HERMIONE	312	Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about
RON	313	Three glasses who?
HERMIONE	314	Muggle-borns.
HERMIONE	315	Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
RON	316	D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
HERMIONE	317	Yes. Couldn't you tell: McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
HARRY	318	But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that means...
RON	319	Of course! You heard him: 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!
HERMIONE	320	I heard him. But Malfoy? The Heir of Slytherin?
HARRY	321	Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I
RON	322	Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling...
RON	323	When do we start?
HERMIONE	324	Here it is: 'The Polyjuice Potion. Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another...'
RON	325	You mean, Harry and I drink some of this stuff and we turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
HERMIONE	326	Yes.
RON	327	Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!
HERMIONE	328	Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed. And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too.
RON	329	Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it.
HARRY	330	How long will it take to make?
HERMIONE	331	A month.
HARRY	332	A month? But if Malfoy is the
HERMIONE	333	You didn't have to tell me that.
HAGRID	334	Gallopin' Gorgons! Slytherin's
DRACO	335	All right there, Scarhead?
GEORGE	336	HARRY! WATCH OUT!
RON	337	Rogue Bludger?
HAGRID	338	Look fer yerself! It's bin' tampered with!
HERMIONE	339	You're joking, right? Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry. As Harry frantically dips and dives, Malfoy cruises by.
DRACO	340	Training for the ballet, Potter?
HERMIONE	341	Finite Incantatem!
GILDEROY LOCKHART	342	Not to worry, Harry. I'll fix that arm of yours straight away.
HARRY	343	No... no... not you.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	344	Poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. This won't hurt a bit...
GILDEROY LOCKHART	345	Ah. Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. The point is,
HERMIONE	346	You will be able to, won't you?
MADAM POMFREY	347	I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is nasty business.
MADAM POMFREY	348	Well, what did you expect -- pumpkin juice? FLASH! Harry blinks, sees Colin Creevey standing there.
COLIN	349	That was brilliant today, Harry! Brilliant!
MADAM POMFREY	350	Out! All of you! This boy's got thirty-three bones to regrow!
HARRY	351	Dobby!
DOBBY	352	Indeed yes, sir. Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway.
HARRY	353	You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
DOBBY	354	At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home!
HARRY	355	Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
DOBBY	356	Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.
HARRY	357	You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!
HARRY	358	I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
DOBBY	359	Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before
HARRY	360	Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
DOBBY	361	This, sir? 'Tis a mark of the house elf's enslavement. Dobby
DOBBY	362	Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts! Harry Potter must not stay here now that history is to repeat itself!
HARRY	363	Repeat itself? You mean, this has happened before?
HARRY	364	Tell me, Dobby? When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?
DOBBY	365	Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.
HARRY	366	No, Dobby! Tell me! Who is it? CRACK! Dobby is gone. SHADOWS flicker beyond the CURTAIN encircling Harry's bed. Harry slumps down... peers through a slit in the curtains. Dumbledore, in a nightcap, and McGonagall, in a tartan robe, heave a SMALL STATUE onto an empty bed. Seconds later, Madam Pomfrey bustles in.
MADAM POMFREY	367	What's happened?
DUMBLEDORE	368	There's been another attack.
DUMBLEDORE	369	It means our students are in great danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was fortunate. If not for this...
HERMIONE	370	Again? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
RON	371	Of course! Don't you see? Lucius
HERMIONE	372	Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
RON	373	Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?
HERMIONE	374	Never. No one over comes in here.
RON	375	Why?
RON	376	Who's Moaning Myrtle? There is a LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF A
MOANING MYRTLE	377	I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't expect you to know me. Who would ever talk about fat, ugly, miserable, moping, moaning Myrtle? Myrtle SOBS LOUDLY, DIVES head first into the toilet.
HERMIONE	378	She's a little sensitive. 64.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	379	Gather round! Gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent. In light of the dark events of recent weeks,
HARRY	380	Nice to meet you. I'm -- JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY I know who you are. We all do. Even us Muggle-borns. Justin grins agreeably, looks back to the stage, where
GILDEROY LOCKHART	381	Let me introduce my assistant
RON	382	What's the fun in that?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	383	As you can see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position. On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	384	One-two-three --
SNAPE	385	Expelliarmus! A dazzling flash of SCARLET LIGHT bursts forth and BLASTS
HERMIONE	386	Do you think he's all right? HARRY/RON Who cares?
SNAPE	387	Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	388	An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you?
SNAPE	389	Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house. Malfoy, perhaps.
DRACO	390	Scared, Potter?
HARRY	391	You wish.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	392	Wands at the ready! When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent -- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents. One, two --
HARRY	393	Rictusempra! A jet of SILVER LIGHT hits Malfoy dead in the stomach.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	394	I said disarm only!
DRACO	395	Serpensortia! To Harry's horror, the tip of Malfoy's wand EXPLODES and a LONG BLACK SNAKE SLITHERS forth. Snape smiles with amusement.
SNAPE	396	Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	397	Allow me!
RON	398	You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't you tell us?
HARRY	399	I'm a what?
HERMIONE	400	You can talk to snakes.
HARRY	401	I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.
HARRY	402	What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin --
RON	403	Oh, that's what you said to it.
HARRY	404	You were there! You heard me!
RON	405	I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language.
HARRY	406	I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize -- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
HERMIONE	407	I don't know, Harry. But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. It was... creepy.
HERMIONE	408	Harry, listen out me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar
RON	409	Exactly. And now the whole
HARRY	410	But I'm not. I... can't be.
HARRY	411	Who am I, Hedwig? What am I?
ERNIE	412	So, anyway, I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to
ERNIE	413	Justin let it slip to Potter that
ERNIE	414	Hannah, he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could
ERNIE	415	That's probably why You Know Who
HAGRID	416	All righ', Harry?
HARRY	417	Hagrid... what're you doing here?
HARRY	418	It's nothing. I'd better get going. I've got a lot of studying...
HARRY	419	Professor, I swear I didn’t --
FILCH	420	Caught in the act. I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words...
FILCH	421	Dark magic. That's what you've got, Potter. Even the air you breathe comes out poison. You're
SORTING HAT	422	Bee in your bonnet, Potter?
HARRY	423	Well, you see, I was wondering...
SORTING HAT	424	If I put you in the right house? Yes... you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said last year... you would have done well in Slytherin.
HARRY	425	You're wrong!
HARRY	426	Professor, your bird... I couldn't
DUMBLEDORE	427	About time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had
DUMBLEDORE	428	Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
HAGRID	429	It wasn't Harry, Professor Dumbledore!
HAGRID	430	I was talkin' ter 'im jus' before that kid was found. It can't've bin 'im!
HAGRID	431	I'll swear ter it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic --
DUMBLEDORE	432	HAGRID! I do not think that Harry has attacked anyone.
HAGRID	433	Oh. Right. I'll wait outside then. As Hagrid exits, Harry looks hopefully at Dumbledore.
HARRY	434	You don't think it was me, Professor?
DUMBLEDORE	435	No, Harry. But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me. Anything at all? Dumbledore waits. Harry debates. Finally...
HARRY	436	No, Professor. Nothing.
FRED	437	Make way for the Heir of Slytherin! Seriously evil wizard coming through!
RON	438	Oh, c'mon, Harry. Fred's just having a laugh.
HARRY	439	He's the only one.
RON	440	Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night. Who cares?
HARRY	441	Maybe they're right.
HERMIONE	442	You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't. And if it makes you feel better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too.
RON	443	Why would that make anyone feel better?
HERMIONE	444	Because, in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion's will be ready. In a few days... we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin.
HERMIONE	445	Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
HARRY	446	Crabbe and Goyle.
RON	447	How?
HERMIONE	448	I've got it all worked out. I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful.
HERMIONE	449	You know how greedy Crabbe and
HERMIONE	450	I've already got mine.
HERMIONE	451	Millicent Bulstrode. She's in Slytherin. I got this off her robes.
HERMIONE	452	Remember. Just make sure Crabbe
RON	453	Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?
HERMIONE	454	Did you get it?
HERMIONE	455	I sneaked those out of the laundry.
HERMIONE	456	I'm sure I've done everything right. It looks like the book said it should. Once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
RON	457	Now what?
HERMIONE	458	We separate it into three glasses
RON	459	Ugh. Essence of Crabbe...
RON	460	Think I'm gonna be sick...
RON	461	Harry?
HARRY	462	Ron?
RON	463	Bloody hell.
HARRY	464	We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
HARRY	465	Lower.
HARRY	466	Less intelligent.
HARRY	467	Excellent.
RON	468	Hey... Where's Hermione?
HARRY	469	Hermione, are you okay?
RON	470	Don't swing your arms like that.
RON	471	Yeah. That's better. 84 GLOOMY CORRIDOR/DUNGEONS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 84
RON	472	What are you doing here?
RON	473	What are you doing here?
PERCY	474	I happen to be a prefect. You, on
PERCY	475	What're your names again?
DRACO	476	Crabbe. Goyle. Where have you been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?
PERCY	477	Mind your attitude, Malfoy. You want to show a little bit more respect to a school Prefect!
DRACO	478	Come on, boys. Weasley thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's hair single-handed.
DRACO	479	Listen to this... Draco grabs The Daily Prophet, reads the front page.
DRACO	480	'Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. "Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute," said Lucius Malfoy, a
DRACO	481	Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so
DRACO	482	What's up with you, Crabbe?
DRACO	483	Well, go to the hospital wing
HARRY	484	You're wrong!
DRACO	485	What? Did you say that I was wrong? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
HARRY	486	Harry Potter.
HARRY	487	Then you must have some idea who's behind it all?
DRACO	488	You know I haven't, Goyle. How many times do I have to tell you? But my father did say this much: It's been fifty years since the
DRACO	489	What's the matter with you two? You're acting very... odd.
RON	490	Ho!
DRACO	491	Hey! Where are you going?
RON	492	That was close!
HARRY	493	Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!
HERMIONE	494	Go away!
MOANING MYRTLE	495	Ooh, wait till you see. It's awful!
HERMIONE	496	It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look at my face!
RON	497	Look at your tail.
HERMIONE	498	Oh, good. Put those anywhere.
HERMIONE	499	I've got to keep up, haven't I? Just then, Hermione's tail twitches INTO VIEW.
RON	500	Is that thing ever going away?
HERMIONE	501	Any day now, according to Madam Pomfrey. I'm just thankful I've stopped coughing up fur balls.
RON	502	We all are, believe me.
HERMIONE	503	Now. What about the Chamber of Secrets? Any new leads?
HARRY	504	Nothing.
RON	505	'To Miss Granger. Wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.' You sleep with this under your pillow?
HERMIONE	506	Of course not. I don't know how that got there. Now go. I still have six hundred pages to read in Transformation Through the Ages. 91 OMITTED 91
RON	507	I know Hermione's mental, but can you believe she falls for that smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?
HARRY	508	Looks like Myrtle's flooded the bathroom. As Harry sploshes off toward the bathroom, Ron steps lightly.
RON	509	Yuck.
MOANING MYRTLE	510	Come to throw something else at me?
HARRY	511	Why would I throw something at you?
MOANING MYRTLE	512	Don’t ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me...
RON	513	But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?
MOANING MYRTLE	514	Oh sure! Let's all throw books at
HARRY	515	Who threw it at you anyway?
MOANING MYRTLE	516	I don't know. I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head.
RON	517	Fifty points if you can get it
MOANING MYRTLE	518	I HEARD THAT!
HARRY	519	This is a diary. And it's old...
RON	520	It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry.
RON	521	Are you mad? That could be cursed. Dad once told me about a book the Ministry confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it.
HARRY	522	I'll take my chances...
HARRY	523	Ginny! I was only joking -- Brilliant. Even your sister thinks I'm the monster now.
RON	524	Who doesn't? Ron frowns suddenly. On the first page on the diary, EMBOSSED LETTERS spell out a name: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE.
RON	525	Tin Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I know that name...
HARRY	526	Special Services to the School or something --
HERMIONE	527	Fifty years ago? You're sure?
HARRY	528	Yes. Why?
HERMIONE	529	Don't you remember what Malfoy told you? The last time the
HARRY	530	Fifty years ago! That means --
HARRY	531	That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in this diary.
HERMIONE	532	It might be invisible ink.
HERMIONE	533	I don't know, Harry. But I think you should be careful with this. Something tells me Ron might be right. It could be dangerous.
HARRY	534	You don't think I'm dangerous, do you, Hermione? I mean, you're not scared. Of me.
HERMIONE	535	I'm scared, Harry. But not of you.
HARRY	536	Do... you... know... anything... about... the... Chamber... of... Secrets? Yes.
HARRY	537	Can... you... tell... me? No.
HARRY	538	Excuse me. Could you tell me where I am? Hello...?
DUMBLEDORE	539	It's not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE	540	Yes, Professor. I suppose I -- I just had to see for myself, if...
TOM RIDDLE	541	... the rumors were true.
DUMBLEDORE	542	Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I'm afraid.
TOM RIDDLE	543	Sir? If it all stopped. If the person responsible was caught...
DUMBLEDORE	544	Is there something you wish to tell me, Tom?
DUMBLEDORE	545	Very well then. Hurry along.
TOM RIDDLE	546	Evening, Hagrid.
TOM RIDDLE	547	I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone --
YOUNG HAGRID	548	No, yeh can't! Yeh don' understand!
TOM RIDDLE	549	Hagrid. The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the
RIDDLE	550	Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now... stand aside...
YOUNG HAGRID	551	Noooooo!
HARRY	552	Ron! Ron!
RON	553	What? What's happened...?
HARRY	554	It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the
HERMIONE	555	It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
RON	556	We don't even know this Riddle.
HERMIONE	557	Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go ask him about it?
RON	558	That'd be a cheerful visit. Hullo, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?
HAGRID	559	Mad an' hairy? Wouldn' be talkin' 'bou me, now would yeh?
HARRY	560	What's that you've got, Hagrid?
HAGRID	561	Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. Fer
NEVILLE	562	Harry, I don't know who did it, but... you'd better come.
HERMIONE	563	It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless, it wasn't a student...
RON	564	Well, whoever it was, they were looking for something.
RON	565	Hey, Ginny! Going to the match?
RON	566	I tell you, she gets weirder and weirder by the day...
RON	567	No... don't tell me...
HERMIONE	568	Harry... I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library! As Hermione sprints back up the stairs, Harry YELLS.
HARRY	569	What do you understand!
RON	570	That's Hermione. When in doubt, go to the library
WOOD	571	Listen up now. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker, smarter.
GEORGE	572	Not to mention they're dead
WOOD	573	That, too.
RON	574	Hermione!
NEVILLE	575	Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin,
DEAN THOMAS	576	I don't care what anyone says. As long as Dumbledore's here, Hogwarts will be here.
HARRY	577	We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him. But if
RON	578	But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class --
HARRY	579	I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again.
HAGRID	580	Who's there?
HARRY	581	What's that for?
HAGRID	582	Nothin', nothin'. I've been expectin'... Doesn't matter. Sit down... I'll make tea... Hagrid nervously takes the kettle, spills the water..
HARRY	583	Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you hear about Hermione?
HAGRID	584	Oh, yea. I heard, all righ'.
HARRY	585	Look... we have to ask you something. Do you know who’s opened the Chamber of Secrets?
HAGRID	586	C-come in.
DUMBLEDORE	587	Good evening, Hagrid.
FUDGE	588	Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.
HAGRID	589	I never... You know I never,
DUMBLEDORE	590	I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.
FUDGE	591	Look, Albus, Hagrid's record's
HAGRID	592	Take me? Where? Not Azkaban prison.
FUDGE	593	For a short stretch only. Not a punishment, Hagrid. More a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be released with a full apology. Just then, there is a SHARP RAP on the door. As
LUCIUS MALFOY	594	Already here, Fudge? Good, good...
HAGRID	595	What're you doin' here! Get outta my house!
LUCIUS MALFOY	596	My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your -- do you call this a house? I simply called at the school and was told the Headmaster was here.
LUCIUS MALFOY	597	Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but
FUDGE	598	Now, see here, Lucius. Dumbledore suspended. No, no... last thing we want right now... If Dumbledore can't stop these attacks... I mean to say, who can?
LUCIUS MALFOY	599	That remains to be seen, but as all twelve governors have voted --
HAGRID	600	An' how many did yeh have ter
LUCIUS MALFOY	601	I would advise you not to shout at
DUMBLEDORE	602	Calm yourself, Hagrid!
LUCIUS MALFOY	603	Admirable sentiments. We shall all miss your highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any more, um, killin's. Malfoy strides to the door and bows Dumbledore out.
HAGRID	604	If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do is follow the spiders. That'd lead 'em right! Tha's all I'm sayin'.
RON	605	Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.
HARRY	606	Look... At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a crack in the glass. Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.
HARRY	607	C'mon. 103. 115 OMITTED 115 thru thru 118 118
RON	608	What are you doing?
HARRY	609	You heard Hagrid. Follow the spiders.
RON	610	They're heading into the Dark Forest.
RON	611	Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'? 120 OMITTED 120
HARRY	612	There's something moving over there... something big. Just then a BLAZE of LIGHT splinters the trees, blinding
RON	613	Harry!... Harry, it's our car! Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford Anglia looks half-animal. Ron circles it in wonder.
HARRY	614	It's been here all the time! Look at it. The Forest has turned it wild. Harry nods, then glances back up the slope.
HARRY	615	C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail.
RON	616	I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --
HARRY	617	Don't panic. As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE
ARAGOG	618	You do not come from the forest. Your hearts beat like... men.
HARRY	619	He's in trouble. Up at school,
ARAGOG	620	That's a lie! Hagrid never opend
HARRY	621	But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.
RON	622	Harry...
HARRY	623	Shhh!
ARAGOG	624	We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
HARRY	625	But have you seen it?
ARAGOG	626	I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here. More SCRABBLING. Ron looks up. We PAN UP with him. SEE: SPIDERS -- in high and low branches -- DROPPING DOWNWARD like paratroopers. Ron GRABS Harry.
HARRY	627	Well... thank you. We'll just go...
ARAGOG	628	Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny
RON	629	Can we panic now? CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! Harry and Ron SPIN. A GANG of FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead. Begin to move forward. Harry and Ron SPIN again: SPIDERS. Everywhere. CLOSING IN.
RON	630	Nice knowing you.
HARRY	631	Let's go! Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE. Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY. A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.
RON	632	Thanks for that.
HARRY	633	Don't mention it.
HARRY	634	That way! It's the only way out!
HARRY	635	Can you get us in the air?
RON	636	'Follow the spiders'! Follow the
HARRY	637	We know one thing. Hagrid never
MADAM POMFREY	638	There's no point in talking to a
RON	639	We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit. She's our... friend, you
MADAM POMFREY	640	Very well then. But be quick about it.
RON	641	You don't think Lockhart could be
HARRY	642	Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever... Just then, the mirror in Ron's hand CATCHES the LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT and casts a jagged FLAME across
HARRY	643	'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.'
RON	644	But it kills by looking people in
HARRY	645	Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly at least...
RON	646	But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake. Someone would have seen...
HARRY	647	Remember what Aragog said? About
SNAPE	648	Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	649	My m-moment?
SNAPE	650	Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where
GILDEROY LOCKHART	651	D-did I? I don't recall...
GILDEROY LOCKHART	652	V-very well. I'll -- I'll be in my office, getting -- getting ready.
PROFESSOR SPROUT	653	Who is it the monster's taken, Minerva?
RON	654	Harry. D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know --
HARRY	655	Professor, we've got some information for you -- Harry and Ron stop dead. Lockhart's office is stripped to the shelves. Two LARGE TRUNKS stand open.
HARRY	656	Are you going somewhere?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	657	Um, well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Got to go...
RON	658	What about my sister?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	659	Well, as to that -- most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I --
RON	660	You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
GILDEROY LOCKHART	661	I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description --
HARRY	662	You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	663	Books can be misleading.
HARRY	664	You wrote them!
GILDEROY LOCKHART	665	My dear boy, do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if
HARRY	666	You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!
GILDEROY LOCKHART	667	Harry, Harry, Harry. There was work involved. I had to track
RON	668	Is there anything you can do?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	669	Yes, now that you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing and I'd never have sold another book. I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you both, lest you do the same.
HARRY	670	Expelliarmus! Lockhart BLASTS backwards, toppling into one of the open
HARRY	671	Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor. 129 OMITTED 129
MOANING MYRTLE	672	Who's there? Oh...
HARRY	673	To ask you how you died.
HARRY	674	Who was it, Myrtle?
MOANING MYRTLE	675	I don't know! I was distraught!
HARRY	676	Just like that? How?
MOANING MYRTLE	677	No idea. I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. Over there... Myrtle points to the bank of sinks. Harry and Ron hurry over, examining the pipes below, the tile above, then...
HARRY	678	This is it, Ron. This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
RON	679	Say something, Harry. Say something in Parseltongue.
HARRY	680	Open up.
RON	681	English.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	682	Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well then. I'll just be going. There's no need for me...
HARRY	683	Oh, yes there is. You first.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	684	Now, boys. What good will it do?
RON	685	A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.
HARRY	686	All right. Let's go.
MOANING MYRTLE	687	Oh, Harry... if you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.
HARRY	688	Thanks, Myrtle. Harry turns. Jumps. Seconds later, Ron follows.
HARRY	689	Lumos!
HARRY	690	Remember. Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away.
RON	691	What's that? Up ahead?
GILDEROY LOCKHART	692	That looks like a... snake.
HARRY	693	Maybe it's asleep.
RON	694	Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long. Or more.
RON	695	Heart of a lion, this one.
HARRY	696	Ron? Are you okay?
RON	697	I'm okay. This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand. Lockhart sits up, dazed. Ron picks up a rock and CONKS
RON	698	What now?
HARRY	699	Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go on and... find Ginny. If I'm not
RON	700	I'll try and shift some of this rock. So you can get back through. And, Harry --
HARRY	701	See you in a bit.
HARRY	702	Ginny! Please don't be dead. Ginny! Wake up! Wake up!
HARRY	703	Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you
TOM RIDDLE	704	She's still alive. But only just.
HARRY	705	Are you a ghost?
TOM RIDDLE	706	A memory. Preserved in a diary for fifty years.
HARRY	707	She's cold as ice. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk --
TOM RIDDLE	708	It won't come until it's called.
HARRY	709	Give me my wand, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE	710	You won't be needing it.
HARRY	711	Listen, we've got to go! We've
TOM RIDDLE	712	I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger.
HARRY	713	But she's dying!
TOM RIDDLE	714	Yes. I'm afraid so. But then, she's been in so much pain, poor Ginny. She's been writing to me
TOM RIDDLE	715	Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
TOM RIDDLE	716	It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and the Squib's cat. Ginny who wrote threatening messages on the walls.
HARRY	717	But... Why?...
TOM RIDDLE	718	Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very
HARRY	719	Hagrid's my friend. And you framed him, didn't you?
TOM RIDDLE	720	It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think
HARRY	721	I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
TOM RIDDLE	722	I knew it wouldn't be safe to open
HARRY	723	Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.
TOM RIDDLE	724	Haven't I told you, that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been... you.
TOM RIDDLE	725	Come now, Harry. Don't look so disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded
HARRY	726	Like what?
TOM RIDDLE	727	Well, how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
HARRY	728	Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
TOM RIDDLE	729	Voldemort is my past, present and future.
HARRY	730	You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort?
TOM RIDDLE	731	Surely you didn't think I would keep my filthy Muggle father's name?
TOM RIDDLE	732	Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.
HARRY	733	He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to
HARRY	734	Fawkes. Fawkes flies toward Harry, drops the ragged bundle, which
TOM RIDDLE	735	Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous
TOM RIDDLE	736	Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. The Basilisk only obeys me.
TOM RIDDLE	737	Fool! Think you're safe! It can still hear you! As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKING BLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE.
TOM RIDDLE	738	Yes, Potter. The process is
TOM RIDDLE	739	Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly
TOM RIDDLE	740	So ends the famous Harry Potter.
TOM RIDDLE	741	Funny, isn't it? The damage a silly little book can do? Especially in the hands of a silly little girl.
TOM RIDDLE	742	What are you doing? No. Stop...
TOM RIDDLE	743	No!
GINNY	744	Harry. It was me! But I swear, I didn't mean to... Riddle made me.
HARRY	745	Ginny. You need to get yourself out... Follow the chamber... You'll find Ron... There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lays
HARRY	746	You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just... wasn't quick enough. Then Harry blinks, looks down. Thick pearly TEARS are
HARRY	747	Of course. Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers.
RON	748	Ginny! Ron wriggles through, rushes forward and hugs Ginny.
RON	749	You're alive. I can't believe it.
GINNY	750	I'm going to be expelled, I just know it!
HARRY	751	Where's Lockhart? Harry eyes Lockhart, sitting by himself, HUMMING placidly.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	752	Hello. Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?
RON	753	No.
RON	754	What's with the bird?
HARRY	755	I think... I think he's telling me he can take us out of here.
GILDEROY LOCKHART	756	Amazing! This is just like magic! 134B OMITTED 134B
DUMBLEDORE	757	Ingenious. Simply... ingenious.
GINNY	758	I didn't know whose diary it was, sir. I swear. I found it inside my cauldron.
GINNY	759	But I understand if... given all
DUMBLEDORE	760	Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley. No, I think you've endured enough. I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however. And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up. Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing?
MRS. WEASLEY	761	A diary that writes back to you! Honestly, Ginny! What were you thinking? Haven't I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain!
DUMBLEDORE	762	You two realize, of course, that in the last few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules? HARRY/RON Yes, sir.
DUMBLEDORE	763	Therefore, it seems only fitting...
DUMBLEDORE	764	Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. We need our gamekeeper back.
DUMBLEDORE	765	First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something. Am I right?
HARRY	766	It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things. Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me.
DUMBLEDORE	767	You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much
HARRY	768	Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?
DUMBLEDORE	769	Not intentionally, but... yes.
HARRY	770	So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be a Slytherin.
DUMBLEDORE	771	It's true, Harry. You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes. Resourcefulness. Determination. A certain disregard for the rules. Yet the
HARRY	772	Only because I asked it to.
DUMBLEDORE	773	Exactly. Which makes you very different from Voldemort. It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry. It's our choices.
HARRY	774	'Godric Gryffindor.'
DUMBLEDORE	775	Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat.
HARRY	776	Dobby! This is your Master? The family you serve is the Malfoys!
LUCIUS MALFOY	777	Out of my way, Potter.
DUMBLEDORE	778	Yes. When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had
LUCIUS MALFOY	779	From the beginning, my only concern has been the welfare of this school and its students. I assume the culprit has been identified.
DUMBLEDORE	780	Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only
DUMBLEDORE	781	Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it.
LUCIUS MALFOY	782	Come, Dobby. We're leaving. As Dobby scuttles toward the door, Lucius Malfoy KICKS
HARRY	783	Sir? I wonder if I could have that.
LUCIUS MALFOY	784	Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
HARRY	785	I think you do, sir. I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day in Diagon Alley. Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then leans close to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS:
LUCIUS MALFOY	786	Prove it!
LUCIOUS MALFOY	787	Dobby, come! Dobby!
LUCIUS MALFOY	788	What? I didn't --
LUCIUS MALFOY	789	You've lost me my servant!
DOBBY	790	You shall not harm Harry Potter! Dobby steps between and -- BANG! Malfoy flies backwards,
LUCIUS MALFOY	791	Mark my words, Harry Potter. You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days. They were meddlesome fools too.
HARRY	792	Just promise me something.
DOBBY	793	Anything, sir.
HARRY	794	Never try to save my life again.
HERMIONE	795	You solved it! You solved it!
HARRY	796	With loads of help from you.
RON	797	Welcome back, Hermione.
DUMBLEDORE	798	Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to
DUMBLEDORE	799	Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled. Everyone cheers, save for Hermione.
HERMIONE	800	Oh, no! At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN. It's
HAGRID	801	Sorry I'm late. The owl deliverin' my release papers got all lost 'n confused. Some ruddy bird named Errol.
HAGRID	802	I jus' want to say... that if it wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an' Ron... and Hermione... Well, I jus' want to say... Thanks.
HARRY	803	There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.
