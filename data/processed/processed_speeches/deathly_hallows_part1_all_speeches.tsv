SCRIMGEOUR	2	These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong... CAMERA FAVORS a pair of wizards, YAXLEY and PIUS THICKNESSE, who turn away as we PULL OUT of the PHOTOGRAPH and SAIL once more THROUGH the turning pages,
HERMIONE	3	Coming, Mum.
MRS. GRANGER	4	Don’t you look lovely. All packed?
MR. GRANGER	5	Are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free?
MRS. GRANGER	6	Quite sure, dear. See the big bold letters that say ‘Sugar Free’? Dead giveaway.
MR. GRANGER	7	Mm. Yes.
MRS. GRANGER	8	Darling, don’t be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be grateful the company’s so clever...
HERMIONE	9	Obliviate.
HERMIONE	10	Goodbye.
RON	11	What are those?
ARTHUR WEASLEY	12	Close the door.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	13	These are for the Order. So many
RON	14	C’mon. Mum’s got dinner ready.
VOLDEMORT	15	Severus. I was beginning to worry you’d lost your way. Come. I’ve saved you a seat.
VOLDEMORT	16	You know our hosts, of course, Severus. Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable. Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence. Are you, Lucius?
LUCIUS	17	My lord?
VOLDEMORT	18	Are you burdened?
NARCISSA MALFOY	19	My lord is always welcome here.
VOLDEMORT	20	You bring news I trust, Severus?
SNAPE	21	It will happen Saturday next. At nightfall.
VOLDEMORT	22	And this information comes --
SNAPE	23	-- from the source we discussed. Yaxley, the wizard seen at the Ministry, leans into the flickering light from the opposite end of the table.
YAXLEY	24	I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that
SNAPE	25	This is a false trail. The Auror Office no longer plays any part in
VOLDEMORT	26	Pius, what say you?
THICKNESSE	27	One hears many things, my lord.
VOLDEMORT	28	Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most
SNAPE	29	To a safehouse. Likely the home of someone in the Order. I’m told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him. We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who
BELLATRIX	30	My lord, if I might, I’d like to volunteer myself for this task. I’d like to kill the boy. Just then a WAIL rises from the floorboards. Voldemort’s eyes flash briefly with RED.
VOLDEMORT	31	Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
WORMTAIL	32	Yes, m-my lord. Right away, my lord.
VOLDEMORT	33	As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be
VOLDEMORT	34	Come now. Surely one of you would like the honor? What about... you, Lucius?
VOLDEMORT	35	I require your wand.
VOLDEMORT	36	Do I detect elm?
LUCIUS	37	Yes, my lord.
VOLDEMORT	38	And the core?
LUCIUS	39	Dragon -- dragon heartstring.
VOLDEMORT	40	My wand? You can’t possibly think I would give you my wand.
LUCIUS	41	No, my lord.
VOLDEMORT	42	For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss
CHARITY	43	Severus, please. We’re friends... Snape’s face remains impassive. Voldemort’s eyes narrow
VOLDEMORT	44	Avada Kedavra!
VOLDEMORT	45	Nagini... Dinner.
HARRY	46	Time for the teary farewell.
AUNT PETUNIA	47	I’ve lived in this house twenty years. And now -- in a single
HARRY	48	They’ll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m
AUNT PETUNIA	49	You think I don’t know that? You think I don’t know what they’re capable of?
AUNT PETUNIA	50	You didn’t just lose a mother that
HARRY	51	Do you have any? Magic?
AUNT PETUNIA	52	What a cruel thing to ask.
UNCLE VERNON	53	Well, this is goodbye then, boy. Harry, standing by the front door, nods, eyes Petunia, who sits in the front passenger seat, a ghost behind the glass.
DUDLEY	54	I don’t understand. Isn’t he coming with us?
UNCLE VERNON	55	Who?
DUDLEY	56	Harry.
UNCLE VERNON	57	Absolutely not.
DUDLEY	58	Why?
HARRY	59	Absolutely not. Besides, I’m just a waste of space. Isn’t that right, Vernon?
UNCLE VERNON	60	Come on, Dudley, we’re off.
DUDLEY	61	I don’t think you’re a waste of space.
HARRY	62	Well... thanks.
HARRY	63	Good riddance.
HARRY	64	I thought you were looking after
SHACKLEBOLT	65	You’re more important.
BILL	66	Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
FRED	67	Wasn’t always this handsome.
GEORGE	68	Dead ugly.
LUPIN	69	Just remember, Fleur, once you’re
TONKS	70	My husband, the joker. By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus and I are -- MAD-EYE
HARRY	71	No! Absolutely not!
HARRY	72	If you think I’m going to let
RON	73	Never done that before, have we?
HARRY	74	This is different. Taking that. Becoming me -- no.
FRED	75	Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.
GEORGE	76	Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever. MAD-EYE Everyone here’s of age, Potter,
MUNDUNGUS	77	Technically, I’ve been coerced.
HARRY	78	Blimey, Hermione!
FRED	79	Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye? Moody’s eye rotates menacingly onto Fred.
FRED	80	Just trying to defuse the tension. Fred takes the flask from George, followed by Ron,
GEORGE	81	Don’t have something a bit more sporty, do you?
FRED	82	Yes, don’t fancy this color at all. MAD-EYE Fancy this: You’re not you, so shut it and strip.
FLEUR	83	Bill, look away -- I’m ‘ideous.
ALL	84	Yes? MAD-EYE
HARRY	85	Here. Moody’s eye rotates onto the real Harry. MAD-EYE You’ll ride with Hagrid.
HAGRID	86	Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only righ’ I should be the one ter take yeh away. MAD-EYE Yeah, it’s all very touching. Let’s go.
HARRY	87	Hagrid! We’ve got to help the others!
HAGRID	88	Can’t do it, ‘arry. My job’s ter get you where we’re goin’ safe ‘n sound -- Mad-Eye’s orders! Before Harry can reply, FOUR DEATH EATERS jet out of the
HARRY	89	What was that?
HAGRID	90	Dragon fire! More DEATH EATERS SWOOP from the sky, give chase. Hagrid DIVES, plummeting for the ground, trying desperately to
HAGRID	91	Hol’ tight, ‘arry! We’ve got ter get yeh out of here! Hagrid hits the purple button again and the motorbike rockets forth. Harry gazes bleakly behind... then
HARRY	92	Hagrid... HAGRID...!
VOLDEMORT	93	Avada... Abruptly, Harry’s arm rises as if on a string, drawn up
MRS. WEASLEY	94	Harry! Hagrid! What happened?! Have you seen the others?
HARRY	95	Is no one back yet?
HAGRID	96	They were on us from the star’, Molly -- the Death Eaters. And You-Know-Who as well.
MRS. WEASLEY	97	Well, thank goodness you two are
HAGRID	98	Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly? Fer medicinal purposes?
GINNY	99	Oh my God! George!
MRS. WEASLEY	100	My boy! My darling boy! What’ve they done to you?!
GINNY	101	Remus! What’re you doing!
LUPIN	102	What creature sat in the corner
HARRY	103	Are you mad...?
LUPIN	104	WHAT CREATURE!
HARRY	105	A grindylow!
LUPIN	106	We’ve been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren’t an imposter.
LUPIN	107	Snape.
HAGRID	108	Someone else is back.
LUPIN	109	‘Harry is the best hope we have.
SHACKLEBOLT	110	What gave you away?
HARRY	111	Hedwig -- I think. She was trying to protect me --
RON	112	Hey ya -- Well... thanks.
HERMIONE	113	Really?
ARTHUR WEASLEY	114	Are we the last? Where’s George? Suddenly... silence. Mr. Weasley eyes all, turns to Lupin.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	115	Remus. Where’s my son?
FRED	116	How do you feel, Georgie?
GEORGE	117	Saint-like.
FRED	118	Come again?
GEORGE	119	Saint-like... You see, I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?
FRED	120	With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey? Pathetic.
GEORGE	121	Reckon I’m still better-looking than you. Better-looking than Bill, that’s for sure.
BILL	122	Mad-Eye’s dead.
LUPIN	123	Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be
HAGRID	124	Wha’? One of us? Tha’s mad. I’d wager me life it wasn’ none of you lot. An’ if it was me I’d kno’, wouldn’ I? Talk in me sleep on occasion, I’ll admit, but there’s only Fang aroun’ ter hear an’ mostly it’s gibberish an’ besides I’d cut me tongue out ‘fore ‘d betray ‘arry e’en in me dreams -- Hagrid stops, blinking miserably. Suddenly, all smile.
HAGRID	125	Wha’s so funny!
HARRY	126	I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?
LUPIN	127	Understood.
GEORGE	128	‘Ear, ‘ear.
FRED	129	Better. 32 OMITTED 32
OLLIVANDER	130	No! No! I believed a different wand would work, I swear!
VOLDEMONT	131	Then explain this!
OLLIVANDER	132	But it makes no sense...
VOLDEMORT	133	Perhaps our friend’s loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail.
OLLIVANDER	134	No! There must be a way! I’ll think of something else!
VOLDEMONT	135	I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake. I won’t be so forgiving next time...
HARRY	136	No one else is going to die. Not for me.
RON	137	For you? You think Madeye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be
HARRY	138	Come with me. Now.
RON	139	And leave Hermione? Are you mad? We wouldn’t last two days without
HARRY	140	Wedding?
HARRY	141	I don’t care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes. It’s the only chance we have to beat him. And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
RON	142	Tonight’s not the night, mate. You’d only be doing him a favor.
RON	143	Do you think he knows?
RON	144	I mean, they’re bits of his soul,
RON	145	What I’m saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy
ARTHUR WEASLEY	146	One. Two. Three!
HARRY	147	Yes.
GINNY	148	I see.
HARRY	149	Dumbledore didn’t want anyone to know what it is we’re doing. If I tell you, I’d be betraying him.
GINNY	150	Zip me up, will you.
GINNY	151	Seems silly, doesn’t it? A wedding. Given everything that’s going on.
HARRY	152	Maybe that’s the best reason to have it. Because of everything that’s going on.
GEORGE	153	Morning.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	154	How’s it look on your end, boys?
FRED	155	Brilliant! Just then, the silk snaps and the trees in the surrounding orchard shiver in a rush of wind. Everyone steps clear of the marquee and watches a TALL WIZARD with GRIZZLED HAIR and SCARRED CHEEK materialize. RUFUS
GEORGE	156	Bloody hell, what’s the Minister of Magic doing here?
HARRY	157	To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?
SCRIMGEOUR	158	I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter. Scrimgeour pitches a CLOTH BAG onto the table before
HARRY	159	And this would be...?
SCRIMGEOUR	160	Don’t be coy, Mr. Potter. Mr.
RON	161	Dumbledore? And me? I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley
SCRIMGEOUR	162	And you, Miss Granger? How would you characterize your relationship?
HERMIONE	163	We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --
HARRY	164	What’s this all about?
SCRIMGEOUR	165	This. Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to
HARRY	166	No idea.
SCRIMGEOUR	167	Come now, you don’t expect me to believe...
SCRIMGEOUR	168	‘Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will
RON	169	Dumbledore left this? For me? Brilliant. Er -- what is it? Ron CLICKS it and all the light rushes from the lamps into the Deluminator, throwing the room into total
RON	170	Wicked.
SCRIMGEOUR	171	‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that
RON	172	Mum used to read me those! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,
RON	173	Oh, c’mon! Beedle’s stories are famous! Babbity Rabbitty? No...?
SCRIMGEOUR	174	‘To Harry James Potter, I leave
HARRY	175	That’s it then?
SCRIMGEOUR	176	Not quite. Dumbledore left you a second bequest: The Sword of Godric Gryffindor. Unfortunately,
HERMIONE	177	To Harry! It belongs to Harry!
HARRY	178	Excuse me?
HARRY	179	You’ll forgive me, Minister. But it’s a little hard to tell the difference these days.
SCRIMGEOUR	180	Dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke. Scrimgeour gazes out the window, eyes haunted.
HERMIONE	181	Where is your guard, sir?
SCRIMGEOUR	182	I came alone. I don’t really need
HARRY	183	You mean -- But that’s brilliant -- I... don’t know what to say.
LUPIN	184	Say yes. Lupin grins, claps Harry on the shoulder and hikes off into the darkness, joining the WIZARDS STANDING GUARD in
LUNA	185	Hello, Harry! LUNA LOVEGOOD approaches in the company of a cross-eyed wizard (XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD) with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candy floss. Both wear robes the color of egg yolk.
LUNA	186	Oh, I’ve interrupted a deep thought, haven’t I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.
HARRY	187	No, ‘course not. How are you, Luna?
LUNA	188	Very well. I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	189	Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial! Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill!
HARRY	190	Nice to meet you, sir.
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	191	I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during
LUNA	192	Come, Daddy. Harry doesn’t want to talk to us right now. He’s just too nice to say so. Lovegood’s eyes burn with righteousness, a TRIANGULAR EYE
HARRY	193	Sir? May I sit down?
HARRY	194	I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir. I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?
ELPHIAS DOGE	195	I certainly knew him the longest, if you don’t count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.
HARRY	196	I never even knew he had a brother, sir.
ELPHIAS DOGE	197	Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private. Even as a boy.
HARRY	198	Sir, I was wondering if you’d had
HARRY	199	Strange, sir?
HARRY	200	Could you tell me from where
ELPHIAS DOGE	201	I’m afraid not. Albus’ messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys. They were
HARRY	202	Just curious. I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.
ELPHIAS DOGE	203	Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that. I can also tell you that when a person passes, it’s only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years,
ELPHIAS DOGE	204	That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it.
MURIEL	205	Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth. I read your obituary, Elphias. Lovely. But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in Dumbledore’s life.
ELPHIAS DOGE	206	I’m sorry you think so, Muriel. I assure you I was writing from the heart.
MURIEL	207	Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn’t made that mistake, I’m sure. Word
ELPHIAS DOGE	208	A monstrous betrayal. I can only conclude the rumors are true and
HARRY	209	Who are you talking about?
MURIEL	210	Well, I don’t suppose it’ll be a secret once the book comes out.
HARRY	211	Who?
MURIEL	212	Who? Bathilda Bagshot! My god,
HARRY	213	Oh, right. Slipped my mind...
HARRY	214	Godric’s Hollow? Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?
HARRY	215	Excuse me? You don’t mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?
MURIEL	216	Of course. The family moved there
ELPHIAS DOGE	217	Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter!
HERMIONE	218	Ron! Ron!
LUPIN	219	Harry! Go! Go!
RON	220	Where are we?
HERMIONE	221	Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad. Just popped into my head. I don’t know why...
HERMIONE	222	This way!
HERMIONE	223	We need to change.
RON	224	How the ruddy --
HERMIONE	225	Undetectable Extension Charm.
RON	226	You’re amazing, you are.
HERMIONE	227	Always the tone of surprise.
HERMIONE	228	That’ll be the books.
HARRY	229	Do you reckon everyone’s alright at the wedding? Maybe we should --
RON	230	They were after you, mate. We’d just put everyone in danger going back.
HERMIONE	231	Ron’s right. Cappuccino, please. A gum-chewing WAITRESS stands behind Harry. Ron, clueless when it comes to cappuccinos, nods to Hermione.
HARRY	232	Same.
WAITRESS	233	Wicked scar.
HERMIONE	234	Too dangerous. If Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, none of
HARRY	235	My rucksack. With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --
HARRY	236	You’re joking.
HERMIONE	237	I’ve had the essentials packed for days. Just in case.
RON	238	By the way -- these jeans? Not my favorite. Bit tight.
HARRY	239	DOWN!
HARRY	240	Stupefy!
HERMIONE	241	Petrificus Totalus!
HERMIONE	242	Go.
HARRY	243	Lock the door, get the lights.
RON	244	This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.
RON	245	So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn’t you?
HARRY	246	It’s better we wipe their memories. We kill them, they’ll know we were here.
RON	247	You’re the boss.
RON	248	You’re the best with spells.
HERMIONE	249	Obliviate. There is a FLASH OF LIGHT and we -- CUT TO:
HARRY	250	How is it they knew we were there?
HERMIONE	251	Maybe you still have the Trace on you.
RON	252	Can’t be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It’s Wizarding law.
RON	253	What?
HERMIONE	254	We didn’t celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I -- we’d prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding...
HARRY	255	Hermione. I appreciate the thought -- honestly. But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
HERMIONE	256	Right. Perspective.
RON	257	We’ve got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.
HARRY	258	I have an idea.
HARRY	259	Mad-Eye...? Just then a great RUSH OF COLD AIR sweeps through the
RON	260	What was that about?
HERMIONE	261	Mad-eye’s doing, I’d guess. In case Snape decided to come snooping. Just then, a FLOORBOARD CREAKS. The trio stiffen.
HERMIONE	262	Homenum revelio.
HERMIONE	263	It’s a spell to reveal human presence.
HERMIONE	264	We’re alone. DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SKY	265	AT DAWN...
HERMIONE	266	Ron! I’ve found him!
HERMIONE	267	Harry, you can’t just disappear. We thought --
HERMIONE	268	It’s from your Mum. To Sirius.
HARRY	269	I’m thinking maybe we should go
HERMIONE	270	Harry. I can imagine why you’d want to go there, but... I don’t think Bathilda Bagshot is going to
HERMIONE	271	Lovely.
HERMIONE	272	Regulus Arcturus Black...?
RON	273	R... A... B.
HARRY	274	To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...
RON	275	R.A.B. was Sirius’ brother? We see the trio from the strange LOW POV again, sitting round the kitchen table. SLOPPY STACKS of OLD DAILY
RON	276	Kreacher...
HARRY	277	Been spying on us, have you?
KREACHER	278	Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches.
HARRY	279	Ever seen this before?
HARRY	280	Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me. Which means I own you too.
KREACHER	281	That was Master Regulus’ locket.
HARRY	282	That’s right. But there were two, weren’t there?
HARRY	283	Where’s the other one?
KREACHER	284	Kreacher doesn’t know where the other locket is.
HERMIONE	285	But was it here? Did you ever see it?
KREACHER	286	Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you!
HERMIONE	287	Ron! RON! Reluctantly, Ron releases the elf.
KREACHER	288	Yes. It was here, in this house. A most evil object...
HARRY	289	How do you mean?
HARRY	290	Where is it now? Did someone take it, Kreacher?
HARRY	291	Who, Kreacher? Who was it?
KREACHER	292	Mundungus. Mundungus Fletcher.
THICKNESSE	293	As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will be required to submit themselves for evaluation. But know this: You have nothing to fear... as long as you have nothing to hide...
CORMAC	294	My father will hear about this.
NEVILLE	295	He’s not here, you fools.
HARRY	296	You mean... it remembers me?
HERMIONE	297	Expelliarmus! Mundungus’ wand soars into the air... into Hermione’s hand.
KREACHER	298	As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!
DOBBY	299	Dobby has also returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!
MUNDUNGUS	300	What are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin’ ‘ouse-elves on me!
DOBBY	301	Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious. And then Dobby heard
MUNDUNGUS	302	I’m no thief, you foul little git. I’m a purveyer of rare and wondrous objects --
RON	303	You’re a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it. Everyone turns. Ron stands in the doorway. Dobby smiles.
DOBBY	304	Master Weasley! So good to see you again!
RON	305	Wicked trainers.
MUNDUNGUS	306	Listen, I panicked that night, all right? I never volunteered to die for you, mate. Can I help it if
HERMIONE	307	Stop lying! Hermione begins to move toward Mundungus. Ron reaches
RON	308	Piece of advice. Let’s not rehash old times. Got it... mate?
HARRY	309	When you turned this place over -- don’t deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right?
MUNDUNGUS	310	Why? Was it valuable?
HERMIONE	311	You’ve still got it.
MUNDUNGUS	312	Wouldn’t be difficult, would it? Bleedin’ gave it away, din’ I? There I was, pitching me wares in Diagon Alley when some ministry hag comes up and asks to see my
RON	313	Right. So let’s do it. Who gets * who? *
HARRY	314	This is completely mental.
HERMIONE	315	Completely, utterly, without question.
SKINNY WIZARD	316	Morning, Reg! Good luck today.
BALDING WIZARD	317	Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn! Forgive me...
YAXLEY	318	Cattlemole!
YAXLEY	319	It’s still raining in my office. Two days now.
YAXLEY	320	You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don’t you, Cattermole?
YAXLEY	321	To interrogate your wife! If my wife’s blood status were in doubt and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think I’d make it a priority. You’ve got one hour.
UMBRIDGE	322	Ah, Mafalda! Travers sent you, did he? Good. We’ll go straight down.
PERCY WEASLEY	323	Oh, yes... of course.
BESPECTACLED WIZARD	324	Sh...careful. Pius Thicknesse appears, trailing a retinue of lackeys.
THICKNESSE	325	Runcorn.
DOLORES UMBRIDGE	326	HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION
BALDING WIZARD	327	It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms. I think none of us will soon forget last month’s Poisonous Duck... Seeing the Red-Haired Witch’s expression, the Balding Wizard turns and, as before, withers at the sight of Harry.
BALDING WIZARD	328	R-Runcorn.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	329	I understand, Wakinda, but I can’t be a party to that.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	330	Hello, Reg. Isn’t Mary in for questioning today? Try to have faith. If there’s anything Molly and I can do for you --
WAKINDA	331	Let me guess. It’s raining in Yaxley’s office again?
ARTHUR WEASLEY	332	Is that a threat, Runcorn? ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
SCARED MAN	333	I’m half-blood, I tell you! My
MARY CATTERMOLE	334	Reg...
MARY CATTERMOLE	335	Yes.
UMBRIDGE	336	Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred? Wife to Reginald?
MARY CATTERMOLE	337	Yes.
UMBRIDGE	338	A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole. Is this that wand? Umbridge displays a CHERRYWOOD WAND. Mary Cattermole nods.
UMBRIDGE	339	Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand.
MARY CATTERMOLE	340	But I didn’t take it. I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander’s, when I was eleven. It chose me.
UMBRIDGE	341	No, no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches. And you are not a witch.
MARY CATTERMOLE	342	But I am! Tell them, Reg! Tell them what I am!
UMBRIDGE	343	What the devil are you doing, Albert?
HERMIONE	344	Relashio!
MARY CATTERMOLE	345	You? It’s you! Reg, it’s Harry Potter!
HERMIONE	346	Harry... they’ve seen you. We’ve got to get out of here.
REG CATTERMOLE	347	MARY!
RON	348	Long story. Nice meeting you.
RON	349	Piss off.
YAXLEY	350	Seal the exits! Now! Harry, Ron and Hermione glance at each other, break for
HERMIONE	351	Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany.’
HERMIONE	352	Quickly!
HARRY	353	Accio Dittany.
HERMIONE	354	Unstopper it. Hermione rips open Ron’s shirt, which is soaked in blood.
HERMIONE	355	Just do it!
HARRY	356	What happened? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.
HERMIONE	357	We were. We were there. But
HARRY	358	Don’t be stupid.
HERMIONE	359	It’s all I feel safe doing.
HERMIONE	360	Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
HARRY	361	What’re you doing?
HERMIONE	362	Protective enchantments. I don’t fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent...
HARRY	363	Tent? Where am I supposed to find --
HERMIONE	364	Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...
HERMIONE	365	How’re the mushrooms? Seem to be
HERMIONE	366	Make sure to leave some for Ron.
HERMIONE	367	So where do we go next?
HERMIONE	368	It scares me a bit, that, thinking it’s a piece of Vol--
RON	369	No, don’t! Don’t say it!
RON	370	It’s taboo -- You-Know-Who’s name.
HARRY	371	How d’you know?
RON	372	I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry. Blimey, what’s that smell?
RON	373	Not bloody likely. Smells like something Ginny would cook.
HERMIONE	374	Tea?
RON	375	Is that it?
HARRY	376	I know. I felt it too.
RON	377	... alive.
HERMIONE	378	I hate it. It’s like he’s here with us.
HARRY	379	That’s why we’re going to kill it.
HARRY	380	Dissendium!
HERMIONE	381	Incendio! Flames engulf the locket and its metal flesh turns scarlet, but then the flames die.
HARRY	382	Expulso!
HERMIONE	383	Confringo!
RON	384	It’s angry.
HERMIONE	385	What’re you doing?
HARRY	386	We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.
HERMIONE	387	I can put it in my bag --
HARRY	388	No.
RON	389	Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn’t bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn’t that bother you?
GREGOROVITCH	390	I told you! I no longer have it! It was stolen from me! Many years ago!
VOLDEMORT	391	You wouldn’t be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch? Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you... As a bony hand -- Voldemort’s -- extends a wand,
GREGOROVITCH	392	Just a boy! Not of the village. It was he who took it. I never saw it again. I swear on my life.
VOLDEMORT	393	I believe you... A BURST OF GREEN LIGHT engulfs the room and...
HERMIONE	394	I thought it had stopped.
HERMIONE	395	You can’t let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it. You have to close your mind. It’s too dangerous --
HARRY	396	It’s not a candle I can blow out, Hermione. It always burns, even if it’s just a flicker. Can you understand that?
HERMIONE	397	Tell me. What you saw.
HARRY	398	You-Know-Who. He’s found
HARRY	399	Yes. How’d you know?
HARRY	400	You-Know-Who wants something
HARRY	401	Well it sets my teeth on edge.
HERMIONE	402	I think he just hopes he doesn’t
HARRY	403	And what gets you through the day?
HERMIONE	404	We’ve all made sacrifices, Harry.
HERMIONE	405	I don’t know. It takes time. I’m doing all I can.
HARRY	406	You’re not doing enough.
HERMIONE	407	Take it off.
HERMIONE	408	Take it off. Now.
HERMIONE	409	Better?
HARRY	410	Loads.
HERMIONE	411	It’s cold. Even though it’s been lying against your skin for days. Hermione sees Harry studying the locket, troubled.
HERMIONE	412	We’ll take turns. Okay?
SCABIOR	413	What’s that? That... smell?
HARRY	414	Good to know your enchantments work.
HERMIONE	415	He could smell it. My perfume.
HARRY	416	We have to leave. We’re not safe here.
HERMIONE	417	I told you. Ron’s not strong enough to Apparate.
HARRY	418	Then we’ll go by foot.
RON	419	I’m hungry.
HARRY	420	What?
RON	421	I’m hungry.
HARRY	422	We’re all hungry.
RON	423	Leave it.
RON	424	Mum can make food appear out of thin air.
RON	425	I said leave it.
HARRY	426	It’ll be dark soon. We need to find a place to sleep.
HERMIONE	427	Good plan.
RON	428	Yeah. Brilliant. Only, correct me if I’m wrong... wasn’t that yesterday’s plan? And the day before that? And the day before that? Walk. Sleep. Walk. Sleep.
HARRY	429	My turn.
HERMIONE	430	None of us do.
RON	431	Wizards were here.
HERMIONE	432	I don’t like this place.
HERMIONE	433	I want to go.
AFTERNOON	434	... OF MUSHROOMS.
HERMIONE	435	Oh my god...
HERMIONE	436	I’ll tell you in a minute.
HARRY	437	Maybe you could tell me now.
HERMIONE	438	Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor? It’s Goblin made.
HARRY	439	Brilliant.
HERMIONE	440	You don’t understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.
HARRY	441	O-kay.
HERMIONE	442	Harry. You already destroyed one Horcrux, right? Tom Riddle’s diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets.
HARRY	443	With a basilisk fang. If you tell me you’ve got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --
HERMIONE	444	Don’t you see! In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor.
HARRY	445	It only takes in that which makes it stronger...
HERMIONE	446	Exactly! Which means...
HARRY	447	... it can destroy Horcruxes.
HERMIONE	448	Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.
HARRY	449	You’re brilliant, Hermione. Truly.
HERMIONE	450	Actually, I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.
HARRY	451	There’s only one problem... Suddenly the LIGHTS CLICK OFF...
RON	452	Yeah, I’m still here. But you two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.
HARRY	453	What’s the problem?
RON	454	Problem? There’s no problem. Not according to you, anyway.
HARRY	455	Look, don’t be shy. If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.
HARRY	456	I thought you knew what you signed up for.
RON	457	Yeah, I thought I did too.
HARRY	458	I don’t understand. What part of this isn’t living up to your expectations? Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?
RON	459	No, I just reckoned after all this time, we’d have actually achieved something. I reckoned you knew what you were doing. I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!
HARRY	460	I’ve told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found a Horcrux!
RON	461	Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to
HERMIONE	462	Take it off, Ron. Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it
HARRY	463	Yeah, he would. D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D’you think I haven’t guessed what you were thinking?
HERMIONE	464	Harry, we weren’t --
RON	465	Don’t lie! You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --
HERMIONE	466	I didn’t! Not like that! Harry -- I didn’t!
RON	467	Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night? Do you! To make sure I don’t hear Ginny’s name or Fred or George or Mum or --
HARRY	468	You think I don’t listen! You think I don’t know what it’s like --
RON	469	NO! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE! YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY! Dead silence. Harry glares at Ron. Hermione looks
HERMIONE	470	Stop! Stop!
HARRY	471	Go then. But leave that. Hermione, eyes flashing with panic, glances from Harry to
RON	472	And you?
HERMIONE	473	Me?
RON	474	Are you staying? Or coming?
RON	475	Fine. I get it. I saw you two
HERMIONE	476	What? Ron, no -- please --
HARRY	477	Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
HERMIONE	478	It’s a Muggle station. Hermione smiles and Harry does too. Harry listens then,
HARRY	479	Hermione.
HARRY	480	You were right. It’s like you said. Snitches have flesh memories. But I didn’t catch my first Snitch with my hand. I almost swallowed it.
HERMIONE	481	‘I open at the close?’
HARRY	482	What do you reckon it means?
HERMIONE	483	I don’t know. But look, I’ve found something as well...
HERMIONE	484	I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don’t think it is. It isn’t a rune and it’s not in Spellman’s Syllabary either. And it’s been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn’t part of the book.
HARRY	485	Luna’s dad was wearing that, at Ron-
HERMIONE	486	What d’you mean -- wearing it?
HERMIONE	487	Why would someone have drawn it in a children’s book?
HARRY	488	Hermione, I’ve been thinking. I -- I want to go to Godric’s Hollow. It’s where I was born, it’s where my parents died --
HERMIONE	489	And it’s exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.
HERMIONE	490	It’s dangerous, Harry. But I have to admit, recently even I’ve been thinking we might have to go. I think it’s possible something else is hidden there.
HARRY	491	Godric’s Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, ‘course it is. Obvious, isn’t it?
HARRY	492	Hermione...
HERMIONE	493	Don’t ever let me give you a haircut again.
HERMIONE	494	I still think we should’ve used Polyjuice Potion.
HARRY	495	No. This is where I was born. I’m not returning as someone else.
HERMIONE	496	Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve! Listen...
HARRY	497	Do you think they’d be in there? My mum and dad?
HERMIONE	498	Yeah. I think they would.
HERMIONE	499	Harry.
HARRY	500	Is it -- ?
HERMIONE	501	No. But look.
HERMIONE	502	Did you know he had a sister?
HARRY	503	No. Harry turns away, walks off. NEW ANGLE - TOMBSTONES
HERMIONE	504	Lumos. Hermione plays the wand’s light over the surface of the stone, then stops. Though deeply worn by time, the symbol is unmistakable: the TRIANGULAR EYE. Hermione rakes the light over the name: IGNOTUS PEVERELL.
HERMIONE	505	Ignotus... Hey, Har --
JAMES POTTER LILY POTTER	506	Born 27 March 1960 Born 30 January 1960 Died 31 October 1981 Died 31 October 1981 “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”
HARRY	507	Happy Christmas, Hermione.
HERMIONE	508	Happy Christmas, Harry.
HERMIONE	509	Harry...
HARRY	510	Yeah.
HERMIONE	511	Someone’s watching us. By the gate.
HARRY	512	C’mon.
HERMIONE	513	I don’t think this is a good idea.
HARRY	514	We look like ordinary Muggles.
HERMIONE	515	Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave.
HARRY	516	Relax. This is right. I know it.
HERMIONE	517	Omigod. Harry...
HARRY	518	You’re Bathilda, aren’t you?
HERMIONE	519	Harry, I’m not sure about this.
HARRY	520	Here. Let me do that.
HERMIONE	521	You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot. Hermione eyes a PHOTOGRAPH of a CURIOUSLY COMPELLING
HARRY	522	Miss Bagshot? Who is this man? Harry stands by a chest of drawers, holding the match over a grouping of PHOTOGRAPHS. Coated in DUST, the figures in the frames flit like ghosts behind veils.
HARRY	523	His name. Can you tell me his name?
HARRY	524	This is him, Hermione. The one I saw in Gregorovitch’s wandshop.
HARRY	525	She wants us to go upstairs.
HERMIONE	526	Why?
HARRY	527	It’s all right. You stay here.
HERMIONE	528	Harry...
HARRY	529	Lumos. Harry sweeps the room, gives a start. Bathilda’s face
HERMIONE	530	Confringo! As Hermione’s spell caroms off the trembling walls, we
HERMIONE	531	Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney,
HERMIONE	532	Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old.
HERMIONE	533	You wanted to know who the boy in
HERMIONE	534	It was in Bathilda’s sitting room.
HERMIONE	535	Yes.
HARRY	536	Well?
HERMIONE	537	For a time.
HARRY	538	Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is.
HARRY	539	Get to the hard part, Hermione.
HERMIONE	540	Wizard rule over Muggles.
HARRY	541	And Dumbledore believed in it?
HERMIONE	542	Yes.
HARRY	543	‘For the Greater Good.’ What does that mean?
HERMIONE	544	It was something Dumbledore came up with. He believed wizards were superior and should rule over
HERMIONE	545	It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer. Dumbledore was
HARRY	546	We’re young, Hermione. And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported.
HARRY	547	Where’s my wand? I’ll take the watch.
HARRY	548	Hermione. Where’s my wand?
HERMIONE	549	It’s my fault. As we were leaving Godric’s Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I’m sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --
HARRY	550	It’s done.
HERMIONE	551	Maybe we can --
HARRY	552	It’s done.
HARRY	553	Leave me yours. You get back in
HERMIONE	554	He loved you, Harry. I know he loved you.
HARRY	555	No...
HARRY	556	Lumos! Hermione’s wand-tip ignites. Harry paints the clearing with light and something GLEAMS: a small FROZEN POOL.
HARRY	557	Accio Sword. Nothing. Harry walks about the pool again and again and
HARRY	558	Diffindo.
HARRY	559	Hermione...
RON	560	Are -- you -- mental? Harry’s eyes pop open. Standing a few yards away, fully dressed and half-drenched, clutching the sword of -- Gryffindor in one hand and the locket in the other, is
HARRY	561	It was you!
RON	562	Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I'd think.
HARRY	563	And the doe. That was you as well.
RON	564	No. I reckoned it was you.
HARRY	565	My Patronus is a stag.
RON	566	Right. Antlers.
HARRY	567	You didn’t see anyone else?
RON	568	No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --
RON	569	Anything?
RON	570	And we did, didn’t we?
HARRY	571	See that? It knows. It’s afraid.
RON	572	What? No. Harry. That thing’s bad for me. I can’t handle it. I’m not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione. It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse.
RON	573	No. I can’t --
HARRY	574	Then why are you here? Why did you come back? Harry’s tone is hard, meant to wound. This stops Ron.
HARRY	575	I’ll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don’t hesitate. I don’t know what’s in here, but it’ll put up a fight. The bit of Riddle that was
HARRY	576	On three. One. Two. Three.
HARRY	577	Stab it, Ron. Now.
HARRY	578	Don’t listen to it. VOICE (V.O.) I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears...
HARRY	579	Ron. Don’t listen to it! VOICE (V.O.) Least loved, by the mother who craved a daughter. Least loved, by the girl who prefers your friend...
HARRY	580	Ron. Stab it!
HARRY	581	Ron. It lies! Stab it! STAB IT! RIDDLE-HARRY
HARRY	582	Do it, Ron! Kill it! Ron’s head turns then, to Harry, and Harry freezes. A
HARRY	583	After you left, she cried for a week. She’s like my sister.
RON	584	I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left.
HARRY	585	You’ve sort of made up for it tonight. Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux.
RON	586	Saving your life.
HARRY	587	That too.
RON	588	And just think of it. Only three to go.
HERMIONE	589	Everything all right?
HARRY	590	Fine. Actually... more than fine.
RON	591	Hey.
RON	592	Wo -- hey -- ouch!
HARRY	593	Um... I don’t know?
HERMIONE	594	Never mind why he’s got my wand --
HERMIONE	595	You destroyed it?
HERMIONE	596	And exactly how is it you have the Sword of Gryffindor?
HARRY	597	It’s a long story.
HERMIONE	598	Don’t think this changes anything.
RON	599	No, of course not. I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux! Why would that change anything! Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you! To see you doing those things -- Ron stops.
HERMIONE	600	See me doing what things?
HERMIONE	601	What happened out there?
RON	602	Look, I wanted to come back the minute I’d left. I just... didn’t know how to find you.
HARRY	603	Exactly how did you find us?
RON	604	With this.
RON	605	It doesn’t just turn off lights. I don’t know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I’d given some Snatchers the slip
HARRY	606	It?
RON	607	A voice. Ron turns to Hermione, holds up the Deluminator.
RON	608	Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of this.
HERMIONE	609	And what may I ask did I say?
RON	610	My name. Just my name. Like a whisper.
RON	611	So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew.
HARRY	612	Knew what?
RON	613	Just knew. On account of Hermione’s voice. And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here.
RON	614	I could feel it inside me. It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea. And I knew it would take me where I needed to go.
RON	615	I’ve always liked it. These flames Hermione makes.
RON	616	How long you reckon she’ll stay mad at me?
HARRY	617	Keep talking ‘bout that little ball of light touching your heart
RON	618	It was true. Every word.
RON	619	Bloody hell. I just realized. You need a wand, right?
HARRY	620	Yeah...
RON	621	Well, I’ve got one. Here. It’s Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it’ll do. I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back.
HARRY	622	Engorgio.
RON	623	Wo.
HARRY	624	Reducio! As the flames subside, Ron pats down a small flare-up on
HERMIONE	625	What’s going on in there? HARRY/RON Nothing.
HERMIONE	626	We need to talk.
HARRY	627	Sorry?
HERMIONE	628	See this? It’s a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature. It’s the mark again. Hermione turns the book in Harry’s direction. Dumbledore replaced the “A” in Albus with the TRIANGULAR EYE.
HERMIONE	629	It keeps cropping up. Here. In Beedle the Bard. In the graveyard in Godric’s Hollow -- what?
HARRY	630	Jesus. It was there too.
HERMIONE	631	Where?
HARRY	632	Outside Gregorovitch’s wand shop. on the alley wall...
RON	633	But what does it mean?
HERMIONE	634	Harry, you don’t have a clue where
RON	635	I think Hermione’s right. I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it? Those in favor...
RON	636	Sorry, Harry. Looks like it’s
HARRY	637	Not still mad at him, are you?
HERMIONE	638	I’m always mad at him.
RON	639	Luna?
RON	640	Keep off the dirigible plums.
HARRY	641	Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I’m Harry Potter. We met a few months back? Lovegood’s eyes drift to Harry’s scar.
HARRY	642	Would it be okay if we came in? It won’t take long, sir. I promise. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY... - PT. 1 - Rev. 6/11/10 114.
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	643	Excuse me. As Lovegood steps to the wheezing press, the trio glance at past QUIBBLERS laying about: MUGGLE MURDERS RISE, DOZENS DIE AS DEATH EATERS ATTACK, HARRY IN HIDING, WHERE IS THE CHOSEN ONE? YOU-KNOW-WHO CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM: QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP CANCELLED AMID DEATH THREATS. Abruptly, the press goes silent and Lovegood turns.
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	644	So. What brings you here, Mr. Potter?
HARRY	645	Well, sir, we need some help.
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	646	Ah. Help. I see. Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry Potter, rather dangerous these days...
RON	647	Aren’t you the one who keeps
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	648	I have expressed that view, yes. In the past. Would you excuse me one moment. I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you... Lovegood dashes from the room.
HARRY	649	What’s going on here?
HERMIONE	650	Do you see that?
RON	651	Well, yeah, of course. It’s massive, isn’t it?
HERMIONE	652	No! Don’t go near it!
HERMIONE	653	It’s an Erumpent horn. It’s a Class B Tradeable Material.
RON	654	Yeah, all right... Just then, Lovegood returns with a TRAY rattling with
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	655	May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make it ourselves.
HERMIONE	656	Where is Luna, sir?
HARRY	657	Well, sir, it’s about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding. A symbol...
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	658	You mean this?
HARRY	659	Yes! Exactly. What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	660	What is it? Well, it’s the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course. HARRY/RON/HERMIONE
HERMIONE	661	It’s in here.
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	662	Well, there’s no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale. Why don’t you read it aloud, Miss...?
HERMIONE	663	Granger. Well... all right.
RON	664	Midnight. Mum always said midnight.
HERMIONE	665	In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass... As Hermione continues, Lovegood looks out the window. A CROW cycles INTO VIEW and we FOLLOW it, the sky DARKENING...
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	666	Well, there you are. Those are
HARRY	667	Sorry... I still don’t really understand... Lovegood turns and, taking quill and parchment, draws a STRAIGHT VERTICAL LINE...
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	668	Ah, but your tea’s grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right back.
HERMIONE	669	It’s obvious, isn’t it?
RON	670	You’re supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible. Dead boring if you ask me. But an unbeatable wand!
HERMIONE	671	Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.
RON	672	Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you’d lead.
HARRY	673	Well, you could bring people back, couldn’t you? Mad-Eye. Dumbledore. Sirius. Anybody.
HARRY	674	But I have one. The Invisibility Cloak my father left me.
HERMIONE	675	There have always been Cloaks --
RON	676	Not like Harry’s. I’ve seen a fair few. Dad used to bring home
HARRY	677	And I think I’ve actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore’s office
RON	678	You forgot the water.
RON	679	For the tea.
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	680	Did, didn’t I? How silly of me.
HERMIONE	681	No matter, sir. We really ought to be go--
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	682	No, you mustn’t --
HARRY	683	Sir?
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	684	You’re my only hope. They were angry, you see, about what I’d
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	685	Him. Surely you call him You-Know-
RON	686	Nooooooooo! Instantly, out the window, FIGURES on BROOMSTICKS appear in the sky, jetting directly toward the house. As Harry, Ron and Hermione hit the floor, ROPES of LIGHT ricochet off the windowsill. The printing press EXPLODES, raining Quibblers everywhere, like a flock of doves, smoking with flames. Lovegood waves madly from the window.
XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD	687	Stop! I’ve got him --
HERMIONE	688	Ron! Harry! Take my hand!
RON	689	That treacherous old bleeder! Is there no one we can trust!
RON	690	I’ll do the enchantments.
SNATCHERS.	691	A wand BLOOMS above, illuminates the face of Scabior. Hermione’s red scarf, now faded and filthy, dangles from
SCABIOR	692	Hello, beautiful.
GRINDELWALD	693	Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day. But surely you must know I no longer have what you seek... A SHADOW -- Voldemort’s -- falls across Grindelwald.
VOLDEMORT	694	If not you, then who?
GRINDELWALD	695	You’re so innocent, Tom. Like a schoolboy. There’s so much you don’t understand...
VOLDEMORT	696	Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where to find it! Tell me who possesses it! The name, Grindelwald! The name!
GRINDELWALD	697	Can’t you guess, Tom? It lies
HERMIONE	698	What’re you saying?
HARRY	699	He knows where it is, You-Know-
HERMIONE	700	Stop it!
SCABIOR	701	Your boyfriend’ll get worse than
SCABIOR	702	What happened to you, ugly?
SCABIOR	703	What’s your name?
HARRY	704	Dudely. Vernon Dudley.
SCABIOR	705	Check the list. And you, ginger?
RON	706	Stan Shunpike.
SCABIOR	707	Like ‘ell you are. We know skinny Stan. Try again.
RON	708	Weasley...
SCABIOR	709	Weasley, eh? Wouldn’t be related to that blood traitor Arthur Weasley, would you?
RON	710	Piss off! Arthur Weasley’s ten times the wizard you are!
SCABIOR	711	Worth ten times you if I can find him. Wasn’t you that tipped him off, was it?
SCABIOR	712	How ‘bout you, lovely? What do they call you...?
HERMIONE	713	Penelope Clearwater. Half-blood.
SCABIOR	714	You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you’re going to be my favorite.
SNATCHER	715	There’s no Vernon Dudley on ‘ere. Reluctantly, Scabior turns from Hermione to Harry.
FENRIR GREYBACK	716	Hear that, ugly? The list says you’re lying. How come you don’t want us to know who you are? Hm?
SCABIOR	717	Change of plans, boys. We won’t be taking this lot to the Ministry.
HARRY	718	What did you put on me?
HERMIONE	719	A Stinging Jinx.
HARRY	720	How long will it last?
HERMIONE	721	Not long.
BELLATRIX	722	Show me.
