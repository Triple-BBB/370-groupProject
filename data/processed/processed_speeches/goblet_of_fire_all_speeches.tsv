TITLES	1	
OLD MAN	2	Bloody kids.
EXT. DARKNESS	3	The old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch.
WORMTAIL	4	Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy..
VOLDEMORT	5	NO! The boy is everything, it cannot
UNKNOWN MAN	6	I will not disappoint you my lord.
VOLDEMORT	7	Good. First, gather our old comrades.
VOLDEMORT	8	Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.
VOLDEMORT	9	Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.  A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic.
HERMIONE	10	Harry!
HERMIONE	11	Are you alright?
HARRY	12	Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?
HERMIONE	13	Just now. You?
HARRY	14	Last night.
HERMIONE	15	Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
RON	16	Bloody hell.
HERMIONE	17	Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.
EXT. GRASSLAND	18	
HARRY	19	Where are we actually going?
RON	20	Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?
ARTHUR	21	Haven't the foggiest, keep up!
AMOS	22	Arthur! It's about time son.
ARTHUR	23	Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory
CEDRIC	24	Yes sir.
AMOS	25	Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter.
HARRY	26	Yes sir. This way.
AMOS	27	Great great pleasure.
HARRY	28	Pleasure to meet you too sir.
ARTHUR	29	That's it sir, just over there.
AMOS	30	Shall we? We don't want to be late.   Camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside.
FRED	31	That isn't just any old manky boot mate.
GEORGE	32	It's a portkey.
AMOS	33	Time to go. Ready?
HARRY	34	What's a 'portkey'?
AMOS	35	After 3. One... Two...
ARTHUR	36	Harry!
AMOS	37	Three!  There's a white flash and suddenly they're all flying through the air. Everyone cheers.
ARTHUR	38	Let go kids!
HERMIONE	39	What??
ARTHUR	40	Let! Go!  Harry, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with a thump. Arthur, Amos and Cedric come down more gracefully.
ARTHUR	41	I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?
HARRY	42	Thanks.  They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd gathered and cheering, tents are set up all over.
ARTHUR	43	Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!
AMOS	44	Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match.  Amos and Cedric separate and walk off.
HARRY	45	See ya later Cedric.
ARTHUR	46	Home sweet home.
ARTHUR	47	Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.
TWINS	48	Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
ARTHUR	49	Feet off the table.
TWINS	50	Feet off the table.
EXT. HILLSIDE	51	We pan up the hillside onto a large stadium which seems to have a huge number of floors.
RON	52	Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?
LUCIUS	53	Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know
DRACO	54	Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius
LUCIUS	55	Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can.  The ceremonies begin. Balloons fly and fireworks go off.
ARTHUR	56	Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for.
GEORGE	57	Come on!
FRED	58	It's the Irish!
GEORGE	59	Here come the Bulgarians!
WEASLEYS	60	Krum!!!
GEORGE	61	Yes!
ANNOUNCER	62	Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin!
RON	63	There's no one like Krum. He's like
GINNY	64	Think you're in love Ron?
BOYS	65	When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
ARTHUR	66	Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now.
EXT. OUTSIDE THE TENT	67	
ARTHUR	68	Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility.  Some figures in pointed hoods carrying flaming torches are walking across the campsite chanting ominous noises. The crowd is paniced and rushing all over. Harry is trampled unconscious.
RON	69	Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.
HARRY	70	What is THAT?
ARTHUR	71	Stop! That's my son.  Arthur and others approach.
ARTHUR	72	Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?
BARTY	73	Which of you conjured this?
ARTHUR	74	You can't possibly..
BARTY	75	Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!
HARRY	76	Crime?
ARTHUR	77	Barty, they're just kids.
HARRY	78	What crime?
HARRY	79	Those people tonight, in the masks...
BARTY	80	Follow me.
HARRY	81	There was a man. Before. There.
BARTY	82	All of you, this way.
ARTHUR	83	Harry, who?
HARRY	84	I dunno. I didn't see his face.
LADY OFFSCREEN	85	Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley?
LADY	86	Anything from the trolley dears?
RON	87	Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
RON	88	On second thought, just the drewbals.
HARRY	89	It's alright I'll get it.
RON	90	Just the drewbals, thanks.
CHO	91	Two pumpkin pasties please.
CHO	92	Thank you.
LADY	93	Anything sweet for you dear?
HARRY	94	Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.
HERMIONE	95	This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?
RON	96	Loads according to Dad, that's what
HERMIONE	97	It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.
HARRY	98	I'm fine.
HERMIONE	99	You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.
EXT. HOGWARTS	100	We see four flying horses flying through the air pulling a carriage coming in to land at Hogwarts. The crowds cheer.
HAGRID	101	Clear the runway.
HARRY	102	Well there's something you don't see every day.  A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too.
DUMBLEDORE	103	Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...
DUMBLEDORE	104	So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic
STUDENT	105	Blimey, that's one big woman.
DUMBLEDORE	106	And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff.   A series of older boys walk up the aisle brandishing bo staffs,
IGOR	107	Albus!
DUMBLEDORE	108	Igor.
MADAME MAXIME	109	Professor Dumbledore, my horses have
DUMBLEDORE	110	Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing
MADAME MAXIME	111	But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey.  The man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork
MAN	112	You idiot!
DUMBLEDORE	113	Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.
FRED	114	Wicked.
DUMBLEDORE	115	For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.  Thunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof
RON	116	Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.
DUMBLEDORE	117	My dear old friend, thanks for coming.   MAD-EYE That stupid roof.  Mad-Eye takes a drink.
PUPIL	118	What's that he's drinking do you suppose?
HARRY	119	I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.
BARTY	120	After much deliberation the ministry
GEORGE	121	That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
DUMBLEDORE	122	Silence!  Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing a blue flame.
DUMBLEDORE	123	The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament
HERMIONE	124	Three sir.  MAD-EYE
PUPIL	125	Aw no way, the old codger can see out
RON	126	Yes...  MAD-EYE Give us a curse.
RON	127	Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse.  MAD-EYE Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.  Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it.  MAD-EYE Hello. What a little beauty.
NEVILLE	128	There's the um... The cruciatus curse.   MAD-EYE Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse.  Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals.
HERMIONE	129	Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering
HERMIONE	130	There's a reason those curses are unforgivable,
HERMIONE	131	Neville?
RON	132	Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be
HARRY	133	Yeah well rather you than me.  The twins come up cheering.
GEORGE	134	Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it.
FRED	135	Cooked it up just this morning.
HERMIONE	136	It's not going to work.
FRED	137	Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.
HERMIONE	138	You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
FRED	139	So?
HERMIONE	140	So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
GEORGE	141	That's why it's so brilliant.
GEORGE	142	Ready Fred?
FRED	143	Ready George?
GEORGE	144	You said..
DUMBLEDORE	145	Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!  Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously.
DUMBLEDORE	146	The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!  The Durmstrang crowd cheer. Another name comes out.
DUMBLEDORE	147	The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour  The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes out.
DUMBLEDORE	148	The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.   Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage.
DUMBLEDORE	149	Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!  People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads...
HAGRID	150	No... No.
HERMIONE	151	Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
VOICE	152	He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet.
DUMBLEDORE	153	Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
HARRY	154	No sir.
DUMBLEDORE	155	Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
HARRY	156	No sir.
DUMBLEDORE	157	You're absolutely sure?
HARRY	158	Yes sir.
IGOR	159	You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye.  MAD-EYE It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?
DUMBLEDORE	160	That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.
BARTY	161	The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract.
MCGONAGALL	162	This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?
DUMBLEDORE	163	What do you suggest Minerva?
MCGONAGALL	164	Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
DUMBLEDORE	165	You heard Barty the rules are clear.
SEVERUS	166	Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time
DUMBLEDORE	167	I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?  MAD-EYE I can do that.
RON	168	How did you do it?
RON	169	Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
HARRY	170	Let you know what?
RON	171	You know bloody well what.
HARRY	172	I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.
RON	173	Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend.
HARRY	174	I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok.
RON	175	Piss off.
RITA	176	What a charismatic quartet. Hello!   The four tri-wizard champions are stood together in a group.
RITA	177	I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely.
RITA	178	This is cosy.
HARRY	179	It's a broomcupboard.
RITA	180	You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you?
HARRY	181	Oh, no.
RITA	182	So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve..
HARRY	183	I'm fourteen.
RITA	184	...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?
HARRY	185	I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
RITA	186	Course you're not just any ordinary
HARRY	187	Fourteen.
RITA	188	The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament.
HARRY	189	No I didn't enter.
RITA	190	Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry. (to the quill) Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish.
HARRY	191	AGH!
HARRY	192	Sirius?  Harry picks up a newspaper, the headline reads "THE CHAMPIONS ARE SELECTED" and reads.
HARRY	193	Sirius?! How...
SIR	194	I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?
HARRY	195	No!
SIR	196	Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third
HARRY	197	I dunno.
SIR	198	You didn't hear a name?
SIR	199	What was that?
HARRY	200	He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?
SIR	201	Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more.
HARRY	202	What are you saying?
SIR	203	I'm saying the devils are inside the
HARRY	204	Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
SIR	205	I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
HARRY	206	I'm not ready for this Sirius.
SIR	207	You don't have a choice.
HARRY	208	Someone's coming!
SIR	209	Keep your friends close Harry.
RON	210	Who you talking to?
HARRY	211	Who says I was talking to anyone.
RON	212	I heard voices.
HARRY	213	Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time.
RON	214	You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.  Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone. The newspaper in the fire has the headline "TEENAGE TRAGEDY".
EXT. LAKESIDE	215	
NEVILLE	216	Amazing. Amazing.
HARRY	217	Neville! You're doing it again!
NEVILLE	218	Oh, right sorry.
NEVILLE	219	Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
HERMIONE	220	Ronald would like me to tell you that
HARRY	221	Is that right? Well.... what?
HERMIONE	222	Uhhh...
HERMIONE	223	Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
HARRY	224	Well you can tell Ronald...
HERMIONE	225	I'm NOT an owl!
HAGRID	226	Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?
HARRY	227	Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
HAGRID	228	You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important.
HARRY	229	What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
HAGRID	230	As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again.   We hear animal noises. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid.
MADAME MAXIME	231	Hagrid?
HAGRID	232	Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.
HAGRID	233	Bonsoir Olympe.
MADAME MAXIME	234	Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me.
HAGRID	235	Couldn't forget you Olympe.
MADAME MAXIME	236	What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.
HAGRID	237	You'll be glad you came. Trust me.   A dragon nearby gives a loud roar.
MADAME MAXIME	238	Ahh, c'est magnifique!  In an opening we see people are running about, dragons are roaring and breathing fire.
MADAME MAXIME	239	Can we get closer?
HARRY	240	Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.
HAGRID	241	Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.  A huge flame fires up.
HAGRID	242	Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor
HARRY	243	Thanks.
BOY	244	Like the badge?
HARRY	245	Excuse me..
CEDRIC	246	Alright.
HARRY	247	Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.
CEDRIC	248	Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum,
HARRY	249	Yes.
CEDRIC	250	Right. Hey listen, about the badges.
HARRY	251	Don't worry about it.
RON	252	You think so?
HARRY	253	I know so.
RON	254	Anything else?
HARRY	255	Yeah. Stay away from me.
RON	256	Fine.
DRACO	257	Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last
FIVE.	258	
HARRY	259	I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.  Harry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret.  MAD-EYE I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned.
MCGONAGALL	260	Professor Moody what are you doing?   MAD-EYE Teaching.
MCGONAGALL	261	Is that a student?  MAD-EYE Technically it's a ferret.
DRACO	262	My father will hear about this!  MAD-EYE Is that a threat!
MCGONAGALL	263	We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that.  MAD-EYE
MCGONAGALL	264	Well you will do well to remember it.   MAD-EYE
HARRY	265	Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...  MAD-EYE Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory,
HARRY	266	Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.  MAD-EYE Better than fair the way I heard it.
HARRY	267	But I'm not allowed a broom.  MAD-EYE You're allowed a wand.
HERMIONE	268	Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
HARRY	269	Yeah.
HERMIONE	270	How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
HARRY	271	Battle a dragon.
RITA	272	Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page.
RITA	273	No matter. We've got what we wanted.   Rita leaves and Dumbledore enters.
DUMBLEDORE	274	Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate.
DUMBLEDORE	275	What are you doing here Miss Granger?
HERMIONE	276	Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
DUMBLEDORE	277	Barty. The bag.
BARTY	278	Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will...  Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon.
BARTY	279	The welsh green. Mr Krum...
BARTY	280	The chinese fireball. Oooooh.
BARTY	281	The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...
HARRY	282	The horntail...
BARTY	283	What's that boy?
HARRY	284	Nothing.
BARTY	285	The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?
DUMBLEDORE	286	Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...  The cannon fires immediately.  Transcribed by IMSDb.com
HERMIONE	287	Your wand harry! Your wand!
EXT. HOGWARTS SKY	288	
GEORGE	289	We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
FRED	290	Lose a leg.
GEORGE	291	Or an arm.
FRED	292	Pack it in altogether.
TWINS	293	NEVER!
SEAMUS	294	Go on Harry, what's the clue?  Seamus hands Harry the golden egg.
HARRY	295	Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
HARRY	296	What the bloody hell was that?
FRED	297	Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in.
RON	298	I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
HARRY	299	Caught on have you. Took you long enough.
RON	300	Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.
HARRY	301	Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
RON	302	At least I warned you about the dragons.
RON	303	Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that
HARRY	304	Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.
RON	305	Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.
HERMIONE	306	Boys.
NIGEL	307	Parcel for you Mr Weasley.
RON	308	Thank you Nigel.
RON	309	Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
RON	310	I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
HARRY	311	Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
GINNY	312	I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
RON	313	What are you on about?
HERMIONE	314	They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.
RON	315	Dress robes? for what?
MCGONAGALL	316	The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance.  Groans emerge from the boys who are listening on. The girls seem a lot more excited.
MCGONAGALL	317	Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.
MCGONAGALL	318	Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me.
MCGONAGALL	319	Now, place your right hand on my waist.
RON	320	Where?
MCGONAGALL	321	My waist.
MCGONAGALL	322	Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...  The music starts.
MCGONAGALL	323	One two three, one two three, one two three.
TWINS	324	Never.
MCGONAGALL	325	Everybody come together.  The girls instantly stand and walk forward, the boys are all still seated.
MCGONAGALL	326	Boys, on your feet.
RON	327	Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?
HARRY	328	I think I'd take the dragon right now.
HAGRID	329	I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one
HAGRID	330	And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!
EXT. LAKESIDE	331	
RON	332	This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
RON	333	Well, us and Neville!
HERMIONE	334	It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
RON	335	Now I'm really depressed.
RON	336	Well Hermione, you're a girl.
HERMIONE	337	Oh well spotted.
RON	338	Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
HERMIONE	339	I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
RON	340	Bloody hell.
RON	341	Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
HARRY	342	Agreed.
CHO	343	Harry!
HARRY	344	Cho!
CHO	345	Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top.
HARRY	346	Ok thanks. Cho?
CHO	347	Yes?
HARRY	348	Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
CHO	349	Sorry? I didn't catch that.
HARRY	350	Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
CHO	351	Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said
HARRY	352	Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.
HARRY	353	What happened to you?
HERMIONE	354	What?
HERMIONE	355	No of course.
HARRY	356	Don't be silly.
RON	357	There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.
HARRY	358	What did you do then?
RON	359	What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.  The Patil twins walk past.
PATILS	360	Hi Harry.
HARRY	361	Hey!
ELSEWHERE	362	
RON	363	Bloody hell.
RON	364	What are those??
HARRY	365	My dress robes.
RON	366	Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar.
HARRY	367	Well I expect yours are more traditional.
RON	368	Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
RON	369	I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
HARRY	370	Leave it alone.
HARRY	371	Who?
HARRY	372	Because we'd take the mickey out of
RON	373	Because nobody asked her. I would have
PARVATI	374	Hello boys. Don't you look...
PARVATI	375	... dashing.
MCGONAGALL	376	Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
HARRY	377	Ready professor?
MCGONAGALL	378	To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.
HARRY	379	No.
MCGONAGALL	380	Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil.
RON	381	No. Absolutely not.  Loud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with
PARVATI	382	Harry. Take my waist.
HARRY	383	What?
PARVATI	384	Now.
HERMIONE	385	Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
RON	386	No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.
HERMIONE	387	What's got your wand in a knot?
RON	388	He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
RON	389	Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than
PADMA	390	Are you going to ask me to dance or not?
RON	391	No.
LATER	392	
HERMIONE	393	How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
RON	394	Doubt it. He's way too old.
HERMIONE	395	What? What? That's what you think?
RON	396	Yeah that is what I think.
HERMIONE	397	You know the solution then don't you.
RON	398	Go on.
HERMIONE	399	Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.
RON	400	Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
HERMIONE	401	Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
NIGHTMARE SEQUENCE	402	We're back in the old house.
VOLDERMORT	403	Let me see it again.  A sleeve is rolled up and a marking of a skull and snake in on the arm.
VOLDEMORT	404	Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!
NEVILLE	405	You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!
HARRY	406	Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
HERMIONE	407	I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean
HARRY	408	What's that supposed to mean?
HERMIONE	409	I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
CEDRIC	410	Hey Potter.
HARRY	411	Cedric.
CEDRIC	412	How are you?
HARRY	413	Spectacular.
CEDRIC	414	Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
HARRY	415	Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
CEDRIC	416	Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?
CEDRIC	417	It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water.
HARRY	418	I must be out of my mind.
MYRTLE	419	I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
HARRY	420	Myrtle!
MYRTLE	421	Long time no see.  The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around.
MYRTLE	422	I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry?
HARRY	423	Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?
MYRTLE	424	Well go on, open it.
VOICE SINGING	425	Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took.
HARRY	426	Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?
MYRTLE	427	Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone...  Myrtle laughs and Harry is embarrassed.
HERMIONE	428	Harry, tell me again.
HARRY	429	Come seek us where our voices sound.
HERMIONE	430	The black lake, that's obvious.
HARRY	431	An hour long you'll have to look.
HERMIONE	432	Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic
HARRY	433	Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
HERMIONE	434	Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.  Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway.  MAD-EYE Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger.
HERMIONE	435	But sir, the second task is only hours away and...  MAD-EYE Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!
NEVILLE	436	You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?
HARRY	437	Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.
NEVILLE	438	I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.
EXT. LAKESIDE	439	The Weasly twins are shouting, busy taking bets. Harry is walking
HARRY	440	You're sure about this Neville.
NEVILLE	441	Absolutely.
HARRY	442	For an hour.
NEVILLE	443	Most likely.
HARRY	444	Most likely?
NEVILLE	445	Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.
HARRY	446	You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
NEVILLE	447	I just wanted to help.
HARRY	448	Well that makes you sight better than
NEVILLE	449	You seem a little tense Harry.
HARRY	450	Do I?
EXT. ABOVE WATER	451	
FRIEND	452	I don't know I can't see him.
NEVILLE	453	Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!
EXT. UNDERWATER	454	
EXT. ABOVE WATER	455	
EXT. UNDERWATER	456	
HARRY	457	But she's my friend too!
MERPERSON	458	Only one.  What looks like a shark approaches at high speed. We see that
EXT. ABOVE WATER	459	
EXT. UNDERWATER	460	
EXT. ABOVE WATER	461	
DUMBLEDORE	462	Harry!
DUMBLEDORE	463	I want all the judges over here now.
FLEUR	464	Thank you! And you... (Looks to Ron). You helped!
RON	465	Well... yeah... a bit
RON	466	Merci.
HERMIONE	467	Harry!
HARRY	468	Hermione
HERMIONE	469	Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.   Hermione kisses Harry on the head.
HARRY	470	I finished last Hermione.
HERMIONE	471	Next to last.
DUMBLEDORE	472	Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!
DUMBLEDORE	473	For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been
FRED	474	All that moral fibre eh?
RON	475	Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
GEORGE	476	Well done 'moral fibre'.
BARTY	477	Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter.
EXT. DARK FOREST	478	
HAGRID	479	So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later.
RON	480	We're still misfits.
HAGRID	481	Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!
HARRY	482	Mr Crouch?
FUDGE	483	I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore.
FUDGE	484	The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.
DUMBLEDORE	485	But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think.
FUDGE	486	What did you say? What did you say to me?  MAD-EYE Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private.  Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters.
FUDGE	487	Harry! Harry how good to see you again.
HARRY	488	I can come back later Professor.
DUMBLEDORE	489	Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.
HARRY	490	Agh!  A compartment in the wall opens, there's a glowing blue pool
HARRY	491	Professor?  The man seated next to Dumbledore speaks.
MAN	492	Professor.
IGOR	493	I do sir.
BARTY	494	What do you wish to present?
IGOR	495	I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.
BARTY	496	Mr Rosier is dead.
IGOR	497	Dead?  MAD-EYE
IGOR	498	I didn't know.
BARTY	499	If that is all the witness has to offer...
BARTY	500	Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries.
BARTY	501	Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban.
IGOR	502	NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape,
DUMBLEDORE	503	The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am.
IGOR	504	It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord.
BARTY	505	Silence!  Barty hits the gavel repeatedly.
BARTY	506	Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.
IGOR	507	Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more.
BARTY	508	What's that?
IGOR	509	The name...
BARTY	510	Yes?
IGOR	511	I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and...
BARTY	512	The name! Give me the wretched name!
BARTY JR	513	Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father.
BARTY	514	You are no son of mine.
BARTY JR	515	GAHHHH!
DUMBLEDORE	516	Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.
HARRY	517	Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened
HARRY	518	It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort
DUMBLEDORE	519	Have there been other dreams like this?
HARRY	520	Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?
DUMBLEDORE	521	I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply...
IGOR	522	It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I.
SEVERUS	523	Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?
HARRY	524	Yes sir.
SEVERUS	525	Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?
HARRY	526	Bubble juice sir?
SEVERUS	527	Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
HARRY	528	I haven't stolen anything.
SEVERUS	529	Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why.  Severus closes the door in Harry's face.
EXT. ARENA	530	Music is playing and a large crowd is gathered. The champions emerge.
DUMBLEDORE	531	Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the
DUMBLEDORE	532	On the count of three... ONE...  The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans.
HARRY	533	Fleur? Fleur!
CEDRIC	534	Get down!
HARRY	535	No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
CEDRIC	536	Get off me!
HARRY	537	He's bewitched!
CEDRIC	538	Harry! Harry!
CEDRIC	539	You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me.
HARRY	540	For a moment so did I.
CEDRIC	541	Some game huh?
HARRY	542	Some game.  The wind starts blowing again.
CEDRIC	543	Go. Take it, you saved me!
HARRY	544	Together, on three. One, two, three!
EXT. GRAVEYARD	545	
CEDRIC	546	You ok?
HARRY	547	Yeah, you?
CEDRIC	548	Where are we?
HARRY	549	I've been here before.
CEDRIC	550	It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.
HARRY	551	I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!
CEDRIC	552	What are you talking about?
CEDRIC	553	What is it?
HARRY	554	Get back to the cup!  We see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby.
CEDRIC	555	Who are you? What do you want?
VOLDEMORT	556	Kill the spare.
HARRY	557	Cedric!
VOLDEMORT	558	Do it, now!
WORMTAIL	559	Bones of the father, unwillingly given.
WORMTAIL	560	Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.
WORMTAIL	561	Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.
WORMTAIL	562	The dark lord shall rise again.  The cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges.
VOLDEMORT	563	My wand Wormtail.
VOLDEMORT	564	Hold out your arm.
WORMTAIL	565	Master. Thank you master.
VOLDEMORT	566	The other arm Wormtail.
VOLDEMORT	567	Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me.  Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures.
VOLDEMORT	568	Not even you, Lucius.
LUCIUS	569	My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts.
VOLDEMORT	570	There were signs my friend, and more than whispers.
LUCIUS	571	I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask.
WORMTAIL	572	I returned.
VOLDEMORT	573	Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.  Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.
WORMTAIL	574	Thank you master, thank you.
VOLDEMORT	575	Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The
VOLDEMORT	576	Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!  Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic.
VOLDEMORT	577	That's better. And now...
VOLDEMORT	578	Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up.
VOLDEMORT	579	Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes.
HARRY	580	Have it your way.
VOLDEMORT	581	No!
EXT. ARENA	582	Back at the arena Harry appears with Cedric's body. The crowd
DUMBLEDORE	583	Harry! Harry!  Dumbledore tries to prize Harry from Cedric's body.
DUMBLEDORE	584	Tell me what happened!
HARRY	585	He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back.
DUMBLEDORE	586	It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are.
AMOS	587	Let me through! That's my son! My boy!   Amos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught.
HARRY	588	Not so much now.  MAD-EYE I'd better take a look at it.  We see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking.
HARRY	589	The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.  MAD-EYE
HARRY	590	Who?  MAD-EYE The dark lord. What was it like to stand
HARRY	591	I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.
HARRY	592	Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.  MAD-EYE Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think
HARRY	593	It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...  Mad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry.  MAD-EYE You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the
DUMBLEDORE	594	Severus...
DUMBLEDORE	595	Do you know who I am?  MAD-EYE Albus Dumbledore.
DUMBLEDORE	596	Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?  MAD-EYE No.
DUMBLEDORE	597	Are you alright Alastor?
ALASTOR	598	I'm sorry Albus.
HARRY	599	That's Moody, but then who's...?
SEVERUS	600	Polyjuice potion.
DUMBLEDORE	601	Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.  Dumbledore looks into the pit.
DUMBLEDORE	602	We'll get you up in a minute.
BARTY JR	603	I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
DUMBLEDORE	604	Your arm Harry.
BARTY JR	605	You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.
DUMBLEDORE	606	Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
BARTY JR	607	I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
DUMBLEDORE	608	Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.
DUMBLEDORE	609	I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry.
HARRY	610	Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
DUMBLEDORE	611	Priorium Contatum. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.
DUMBLEDORE	612	No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone.
EXT. HOGWARTS	613	There's a large crowd gathered, the pupils are going home. Viktor
VIKTOR	614	Write to me. Promise.
HERMIONE	615	Bye.
FLEUR	616	Au revoir Ron.  The Beauxbatons girls leave in uniform, the crowd applauds. The
RON	617	Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
HERMIONE	618	No.
HARRY	619	No I don't think so.
HERMIONE	620	Everything's going to change now isn't it?
HARRY	621	Yes.
HERMIONE	622	Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
RON	623	Well I won't. You know I won't!
HARRY	624	Yeah. Every week.
