DARKNESS.	1	THUNDER -- or something like it -- sounds in the distance. BOOM. Then again. BOOM. We GLIDE THROUGH the inky blackness. Ambient flashes illuminate the silhouette of the WB LOGO. We PASS
THROUGH.	2	INTO more darkness. Lost. More FLASHES. And we -- CUT TO:
A SINGLE EYE	3	Blank behind glasses. FLASH! The PUPIL CONTRACTS and we -- CUT TO:
THE STORM	4	itself and... ... PLUMMET, London expanding, stretching out on all sides. We SWEEP madly OVER Charing Cross, leaving the Muggle world behind and SWOOP INTO...
BELLATRIX	5	Narcissa!
BELLATRIX	6	Cissy! You mustn’t do this. He can’t be trusted.
BELLATRIX	7	Or so I believe.
NARCISSA	8	Well, who can one trust these days?
SNAPE	9	Run along, Wormtail.
NARCISSA	10	I’ve nowhere else to turn, Severus.
BELLATRIX	11	You must be joking.
NARCISSA	12	I know I ought not to be here.
SNAPE	13	If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.
SNAPE	14	As it so happens I’m aware of your situation, Narcissa.
BELLATRIX	15	You? The Dark Lord told you?
SNAPE	16	Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable.
NARCISSA	17	I... I don’t doubt you, Severus.
BELLATRIX	18	You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --
SNAPE	19	I can’t change the Dark Lord’s mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. To provide some... protection.
NARCISSA	20	Do you mean it, Severus?
SNAPE	21	I can try.
NARCISSA	22	Oh, Severus, please, if you would... (I would be forever in * your debt.) *
BELLATRIX	23	Swear to it. Snape’s eyes shift, meet Bellatrix’s challenging gaze.
BELLATRIX	24	Make the Unbreakable Vow.
SNAPE	25	Take out your wand.
BELLATRIX	26	Will you, Severus Snape, watch
SNAPE	27	I will.
BELLATRIX	28	And will you, to the best of your
SNAPE	29	I will.
BELLATRIX	30	And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform? Snape’s hand TWITCHES within Narcissa’s. Bellatrix waits.
SNAPE	31	I will.
HARRY	32	Oh. Um. No one. Bit of a tosser.
WAITRESS	33	Funny that paper of yours. Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move.
HARRY	34	Really.
WAITRESS	35	Thought I’d gone round the twist.
HARRY	36	Hey. I was wondering...
WAITRESS	37	Eleven. That’s when I get off.
DUMBLEDORE	38	I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk. No light could resist it...
HARRY	39	I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things. Harry hesitates, notices Dumbledore’s hand is ASH BLACK.
DUMBLEDORE	40	Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t it? The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I’m afraid now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm.
HARRY	41	I just Apparated, didn’t I?
DUMBLEDORE	42	Indeed. And quite successfully I might add. Most people vomit
HARRY	43	Can’t imagine why...
DUMBLEDORE	44	Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I assume right about now you’re wondering why I’ve brought you here, am I right?
DUMBLEDORE	45	Wand out, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE	46	Lumos...
DUMBLEDORE	47	Horace!
ARMCHAIR	48	Merlin’s Beard! Instantly, the Armchair mutates into HUMAN FORM, though briefly gets caught inbetween. After a bit of GRUMBLING, SEAM-SPLITTING and the POPPING of a cushion button or two, a FAT OLD MAN (HORACE SLUGHORN) in a pair of WELL- WORN lilac pajamas appears.
DUMBLEDORE	49	I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
SLUGHORN	50	It’s all in the upholstery.
SLUGHORN	51	Yes, well, I couldn’t very well use wizard’s blood, could I? Oho!
DUMBLEDORE	52	Ah yes. Introductions. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn. Horace, this is, well, you know who this is.
DUMBLEDORE	53	So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren’t perhaps expecting someone else, were you?
SLUGHORN	54	Oh all right! The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year. Do you know what that’s like? One can only say no to these people so many times
SLUGHORN	55	I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.
DUMBLEDORE	56	Well, I think it should be put
DUMBLEDORE	57	That was fun. May I use the loo? As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after.
SLUGHORN	58	Don’t think I don’t know why you’re here, Albus! The answer is still no! Absolutely, unequivocally no!
SLUGHORN	59	You look very like your father. Except for your eyes. You’ve got --
HARRY	60	My mother’s eyes, yeah.
HARRY	61	One of my best friends is Muggle- born. She’s the best in our year.
SLUGHORN	62	Oh, but you mustn’t think I’m prejudiced! No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute
SLUGHORN	63	All mine, each and every one. Ex- students, I mean. You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet.
SLUGHORN	64	Ah yes. Regulus Black. You no
DUMBLEDORE	65	Mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns.
SLUGHORN	66	Of course. But you’re not leaving?
DUMBLEDORE	67	I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable. I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace. You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind.
SLUGHORN	68	All right! I’ll do it. But I’ll be wanting Professor Merrythought’s old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise! These are mad times we live in! Mad!
HARRY	69	Sir, exactly what was that all --
DUMBLEDORE	70	You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning
DUMBLEDORE	71	I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry.
HARRY	72	It’s alright, sir. I’ll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --
DUMBLEDORE	73	You’ll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
HARRY	74	But, sir. What about Hedwig? And there’s my trunk --
DUMBLEDORE	75	Both are waiting for you.
HARRY	76	Sir?
GINNY	77	Hedwig...? Mum!
MRS. WEASLEY	78	What is it, Ginny? Is it your father? Has something happened at
GINNY	79	Exactly. How’d you guess?
GINNY	80	I’m joking, Mum.
MRS. WEASLEY	81	You’re worse than Fred and George.
GINNY	82	Now you’re joking. I was only wondering when Harry got here.
MRS. WEASLEY	83	I think I’d know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn’t I?
MRS. WEASLEY	84	I seriously doubt that. Just then, HEDWIG SCREECHES O.S. Ginny gives her an I- told-you-so when another door opens and RON WEASLEY looks down.
RON	85	Harry? Did someone say Harry?
RON	86	‘Course not. Think I’d know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn’t I?
HERMIONE	87	Was that an owl I heard?
HERMIONE	88	Really?
MRS. WEASLEY	89	But why didn’t you tell us you were coming?
HARRY	90	Didn’t know.
MRS. WEASLEY	91	That man. But then, what would we
RON	92	You’ve a bit of...
HARRY	93	When’d you get here?
RON	94	Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts. That it’s too dangerous.
HARRY	95	Oh come on...
HERMIONE	96	She’s not alone. Even my parents
HARRY	97	But we’re talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?
HERMIONE	98	There’s been a lot of chatter
GEORGE	99	We’ve got Fainting Fancy...
FRED	100	Nosebleed Nougats...
GEORGE	101	And just in time for school...
FRED	102	Puking Pastilles!
FRED	103	What’d you think, Harry?
HARRY	104	Amazing.
GEORGE	105	Bloody urchins.
HARRY	106	Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
FRED	107	Handy if you need to make a quick escape. Hello, ladies!
FRED	108	Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you’re doing just fine on your own.
GINNY	109	Meaning?
FRED	110	Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
GINNY	111	None of your business.
HERMIONE	112	These are adorable. Inside a cage, small round BALLS of FLUFF roll about,
RON	113	How much for this?
RON	114	How much for me? FRED/GEORGE Five Galleons.
RON	115	But I’m your brother! FRED/GEORGE Ten Galleons.
RON	116	C’mon. Let’s go.
LAVENDER BROWN	117	Hi, Ron.
RON	118	Hi.
HERMIONE	119	How is it Fred and George are doing it? Half the alley’s closed down.
HERMIONE	120	Oh no. Look.
HARRY	121	Good. Bad. Speaking of which... Across the avenue, DRACO MALFOY and Narcissa pause, glance around, then slip quickly down an alley.
RON	122	Is it just me? Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don’t want to be followed?
HARRY	123	Dunno. Let’s get closer.
HARRY	124	I don’t know. I’m turned around.
HERMIONE	125	Bloody hell.
RON	126	Sorry. Just then, the cauldron EXPLODES with light. Instantly,
HARRY	127	What just happened?
HERMIONE	128	I don’t know.
LUNA	129	Quibbler...? Quibbler...?
LUNA	130	There’s an article on Wrackspurts this month. Quibbler...?
GINNY	131	Please. What’s a Wrackspurt?
HARRY	132	Don’t you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation.
HERMIONE	133	Stop, Harry, I know where you’re going with this --
RON	134	One of what?
RON	135	You’re barking. What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
HERMIONE	136	I told you. I don’t know what I saw.
HARRY	137	I need some air.
MALFOY	138	What just happened? Blaise?
PANSY	139	Relax, boys. The lights went out is all. Come, Draco. We’ll be * at Hogwarts before you know it. *
MALFOY	140	Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. I think I’d pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for
PANSY	141	What’s that supposed to mean?
MALFOY	142	Let’s just say I don’t think you’ll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year. Confused, Pansy glances at Blaise, who snorts derisively.
MALFOY	143	Amused, Blaise? We’ll see just who’s laughing in the end.
HERMIONE	144	Where’s Harry?
RON	145	Probably on the platform. C’mon.
MALFOY	146	You two go on. I want to check something. Malfoy slides shut the door. LETS THE BLINDS DOWN. A beat.
MALFOY	147	Didn’t mummy ever tell you it’s bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!
MALFOY	148	Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.
MALFOY	149	Enjoy the ride back to London.
LUNA	150	Hello, Harry.
HARRY	151	Luna. How’d you...?
LUNA	152	Wrackspurts. Your head’s full of
HARRY	153	Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna.
LUNA	154	It’s alright. I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend.
HARRY	155	I am your friend, Luna.
LUNA	156	That’s nice. Just then PROFESSOR FLITWICK rushes forth clutching a long roll of PARCHMENT bearing all students’ names.
FLITWICK	157	About time! I’ve been looking all over for you two. Names.
HARRY	158	Professor Flitwick, you’ve known me for five years.
FLITWICK	159	No exceptions, Potter.
LUNA	160	Who are those people?
FLITWICK	161	Aurors. For security.
FILCH	162	And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?
MALFOY	163	Is my father’s. He’s not dead.
SNAPE	164	It’s alright, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy. Draco eyes Snape warily again, then begins to slouch off, catches Harry looking.
MALFOY	165	Nice face, Potter.
LUNA	166	Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way. But it’s up to you.
HARRY	167	Have you ever fixed one? A nose.
LUNA	168	No. But I’ve done several toes
HARRY	169	What the hell. Give it a go.
LUNA	170	Episkey.
HARRY	171	Well? How do I look?
LUNA	172	Exceptionally ordinary.
HARRY	173	Brilliant.
RON	174	Don’ you worry. He’ll be ‘long soon ‘nuff --
RON	175	Oi! Turn around, you lunatic.
HARRY	176	Later. What’ve I missed?
HARRY	177	Thanks... Just then, the light in the Hall begins to gently dim and all eyes turn to Dumbledore, standing at the top of the Hall, ashen hand raised to the enchanted ceiling, where
DUMBLEDORE	178	Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to
DUMBLEDORE	179	Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight. You have a right to know why.
DUMBLEDORE	180	Today, of course, the world knows
DUMBLEDORE	181	Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed. Pip pip!
HARRY	182	This can’t be good.
HARRY	183	Well, you see, I’ve got an open period this morning, Professor -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL So I noticed. I would think you’d want to fill it with Potions. Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
HARRY	184	It is. Or was. But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L. -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL And so you did when Professor
HARRY	185	Really? Well... brilliant. I’ll head there straight away. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Good. And take Weasley with you.
RON	186	But I don’t want to take Potions!
RON	187	Ron Weasley, sir. But I’m dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --
SLUGHORN	188	Nonsense, we’ll sort you out. Any friend of Harry’s is a friend of mine. Right then, books out --
HARRY	189	Um, sorry, sir, but I haven’t got my book yet -- nor’s Ron. You see -- (until this morning...) *
SLUGHORN	190	Not to worry. You can get what you need from the cupboard. As Harry and Ron step to the cupboard, Slughorn resumes,
SLUGHORN	191	Now, as I was saying, I’ve prepared a few concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be? Yes, Miss...?
HERMIONE	192	Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. And that... In the cupboard, Harry and Ron find two TEXTBOOKS -- one new, one shabby and soiled. Both snatch for the new when
HERMIONE	193	... is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world.
SLUGHORN	194	One of my best friends is Muggle- born. She’s the best in our year...
SLUGHORN	195	Now Amortentia doesn’t create actual love, of course. That’s impossible. But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably
KATIE BELL	196	Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in that one.
SLUGHORN	197	Ah yes... Slughorn steps to a SMALL BLACK CAULDRON. Begins to ladle a bit of GOLDEN LIQUID into a TINY VIAL.
SLUGHORN	198	What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --
HERMIONE	199	Liquid luck.
SLUGHORN	200	Yes, Miss Granger. Desperately tricky to make. Disastrous should you get it wrong. But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers. One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off.
KATIE BELL	201	But then why don’t people drink it all the time?
SLUGHORN	202	Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence.
BLAISE	203	Have you ever taken it, sir?
SLUGHORN	204	Twice. Once when I was twenty- four. Once when I was fifty- seven. Two tablespoons taken at breakfast. Two perfect days...
SLUGHORN	205	So. This is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook. Excitement seizes the class. Slughorn smiles knowingly.
SLUGHORN	206	You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. In any event -- good luck.
HERMIONE	207	How did you do that?
HARRY	208	Crush it. Don’t cut it.
HERMIONE	209	No. The instructions specifically say to cut.
HARRY	210	No. Really --
HERMIONE	211	Sh!
MONTAGE BEGINS	212	Students struggle. A cauldron overflows. Lavender eyes Ron. CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD VIAL. THE SUNLIGHT SHIFTS.
SLUGHORN	213	Merlin’s Beard! But it’s perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all! Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can’t you do, m’boy? Perhaps you will save us all in
SLUGHORN	214	Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis. Use it well. Slowly, Harry reaches out... takes the glittering vial.
DUMBLEDORE	215	Good evening, Harry. You got my message, I see. Come, come. Sit.
DUMBLEDORE	216	So. How are you?
HARRY	217	Fine, sir.
DUMBLEDORE	218	Enjoying your classes? Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you.
HARRY	219	I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
DUMBLEDORE	220	Do you?
HARRY	221	Definitely.
DUMBLEDORE	222	And what of your activities
HARRY	223	Sir?
DUMBLEDORE	224	I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger. One can’t help but wonder if --
HARRY	225	No! I mean... she’s brilliant. And we’re friends. But... no.
DUMBLEDORE	226	Forgive me, Harry, I...
DUMBLEDORE	227	... I was merely curious.
DUMBLEDORE	228	What you see before you are memories. In this case pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or
DUMBLEDORE	229	This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him. I’d like you to see it. If you would...
MRS. COLE	230	I must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all
DUMBLEDORE	231	I am not family. But his name has been known to me since birth.
MRS. COLE	232	I see...
MRS. COLE	233	I think I should tell you. He’s a funny boy -- Tom. Odd. There have been incidents with the other children. Nasty things.
DUMBLEDORE	234	Perhaps you could give me an example.
MRS. COLE	235	You’ve got a visitor, Tom.
DUMBLEDORE	236	How do you do, Tom. Riddle eyes Dumbledore briefly, looks away.
MRS. COLE	237	Well, I’ll leave you two to yourselves.
TOM RIDDLE	238	Don’t.
DUMBLEDORE	239	As you wish. Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time,
TOM RIDDLE	240	You’re the doctor, aren’t you?
DUMBLEDORE	241	No. I am a Professor.
TOM RIDDLE	242	I don’t believe you. I hear Mrs.
TOM RIDDLE	243	I’m not mad.
DUMBLEDORE	244	Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
DUMBLEDORE	245	It’s a school. A school of... magic. Riddle stays looking, but says nothing.
DUMBLEDORE	246	You can do things, can’t you, Tom? Things the other children can’t. Riddle eyes Dumbledore intensely, unblinking.
TOM RIDDLE	247	Yes.
DUMBLEDORE	248	Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE	249	Who are you?
DUMBLEDORE	250	I’m like you, Tom. Different.
TOM RIDDLE	251	Prove it.
DUMBLEDORE	252	I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it. Open. It. Terrified, Riddle steps to the burning wardrobe and throws open the door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a SMALL BOX SHAKES VIOLENTLY.
DUMBLEDORE	253	Take it out. As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing
DUMBLEDORE	254	Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?
DUMBLEDORE	255	Why did you want these things, Tom?
DUMBLEDORE	256	Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood?
TOM RIDDLE	257	I can speak to snakes too.
DUMBLEDORE	258	It is unusual. But not unheard of. Dumbledore exits then, without a backward glance, leaving 11-year-old Tom Riddle alone. The IMAGE SHUDDERS and...
HARRY	259	Did you know, sir? Then?
DUMBLEDORE	260	Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time? No. Had I...
DUMBLEDORE	261	Over time, while here at Hogwarts,
HARRY	262	You didn’t bring Professor
DUMBLEDORE	263	No. I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly.
HARRY	264	You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
DUMBLEDORE	265	I did.
HARRY	266	Do you want me to let him?
DUMBLEDORE	267	Yes.
HARRY	268	All right! Queue up! Excuse me...
GINNY	269	SHUT IT! Instant silence. Harry frowns, nods to Ginny nevertheless.
HARRY	270	Thanks. All right. This morning I’ll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths. But know this: Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?
CORMAC	271	No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?
RON	272	Hard feelings?
CORMAC	273	I’ll be going out for Keeper as well. Nothing personal.
RON	274	Really? Strapping guy like you, you’ve got a Beater’s build, don’t you think? Keeper needs to be agile, quick --
CORMAC	275	I like my chances. Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger? Wouldn’t mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean? Cormac gives a lewd wink, saunters off. Ron glances up to the stands. Hermione smiles, waves.
HARRY	276	All right. Cormac. Ron. It’s down to you two for Keeper. We’ll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you’ll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac. Ginny, you’ll take on Ron.
GINNY	277	Piss off, Cormac. How ‘bout I toss you a floater?
HARRY	278	Quiet! I’m Captain. We do it my way. Now line up. On three. One. Two... Three! Demelza and Ginny rocket forth. Ron weaves nervously
RON	279	Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one. Hope Cormac’s not taking it too hard.
RON	280	Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.
HARRY	281	Ever heard of this spell?
HERMIONE	282	No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
RON	283	What?
HERMIONE	284	I’d like to know just whose book that was. Let’s take a look, shall we?
HARRY	285	It’s... old. The binding is fragile.
GINNY	286	Who’s the Half-Blood Prince? HERMIONE/RON
GINNY	287	That’s what it says. Right here. ‘This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.’
HERMIONE	288	For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?
HARRY	289	I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it.
HERMIONE	290	Well, I was curious. So I went to -- HARRY/RON
HARRY	291	And?
HERMIONE	292	And... nothing. There’s no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
HARRY	293	Good. That settles it then.
HAGRID	294	Hey, you three!
HERMIONE	295	What’ve you got there, Hagrid?
HAGRID	296	Stinksap. Burn the whiskers right off yer chin. Trees ‘ere are drippin’ with it.
HERMIONE	297	Stinksap? You’re not sick, are you?
HAGRID	298	It’s not fer me. It’s fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don’ yeh?
RON	299	Spider? About six feet tall? Ten feet wide?
SLUGHORN	300	Filius! I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks.
FLITWICK	301	Emergency choir practice, I’m afraid, Horace.
HARRY	302	Who’s up for a Butterbeer?
HARRY	303	No. Over here.
HARRY	304	No, no. Sit next to me.
RON	305	O-kay.
SKINNY KID	306	What’ll we have?
HERMIONE	307	Three Butterbeers. Splash of ginger in mine, please.
RON	308	Aw, bloody hell...
RON	309	I’d like to leave.
HERMIONE	310	Leave? You can’t be serious.
RON	311	That happens to be my sister.
SLUGHORN	312	Harry, m’boy! Slughorn’s voice BOOMS so loudly even Ginny jumps -- and catches Harry looking. As Slughorn waddles over, SLOSHING mug in hand, Harry rises immediately -- an action so grossly out of character that Hermione regards
HARRY	313	Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you. Hermione, brow wrinkling, turns to Ron, silently mouths: wonderful to see you?
HARRY	314	So what brings you here, sir?
SLUGHORN	315	Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back. Longer than I’d care to admit. In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick! As Slughorn GUFFAWS, Harry joins in, LAUGHING HEARTILY as well. Slughorn’s belly trembles next to Hermione’s cheek
SLUGHORN	316	Oops! All hands on deck, Granger!
SLUGHORN	317	Listen, m’boy. In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two. Would you be game?
HARRY	318	I’d consider it an honor, sir.
SLUGHORN	319	You’d be welcome too, Granger.
HERMIONE	320	Be delighted, sir.
SLUGHORN	321	Brilliant. Look for my owl.
RON	322	What’re you playing at?
HARRY	323	Dunno. But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.
RON	324	Um... You’ve got a little...
RON	325	Bit worried about her. Did you
HERMIONE	326	What’s up? At that very instant, Katie Bell RISES SIX FEET INTO THE
LEANNE	327	I warned her! I warned her not to touch it!
HERMIONE	328	I’ll get someone --
HARRY	329	There’s no time! Suddenly, a MASSIVE FIGURE LURCHES out of the WHITE: Hagrid.
HAGRID	330	Get back! All o’ yeh!
HAGRID	331	Now, now. Now, now...
HAGRID	332	Don’ go touchin’ tha’ but by the wrappin’s. Unnerstan’? Hagrid nods darkly to the package in the snow. Harry kneels. Poking through the paper is an ORNATE OPAL
LEANNE	333	It’s like I said. She went to the
RON	334	Believe me, Professor, I’ve been asking myself the same question for six years. Just then, Snape appears at the door, eyes the trio. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Severus.
SNAPE	335	Is this it?
SNAPE	336	I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
HARRY	337	She was cursed, wasn’t she? I know Katie. Off the Quidditch
HARRY	338	It was Malfoy. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL That’s a very serious accusation, Potter.
SNAPE	339	Indeed. Your evidence?
HARRY	340	I... just... know.
SNAPE	341	You... just... know. Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
RON	342	What do you suppose Dean sees in
HARRY	343	You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
HARRY	344	I don’t know. She’s smart. Funny. Attractive...
RON	345	Attractive?
HARRY	346	You know. She’s... got nice skin.
RON	347	Skin? You’re saying Dean’s dating my sister because of her skin?
HARRY	348	Well, no. I mean... I’m just saying it could be a contributing factor. Silence. Then:
RON	349	Hermione’s got nice skin. Wouldn’t you say? As skin goes, I mean.
HARRY	350	I’ve never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice.
HARRY	351	I think I’ll be going to sleep now.
RON	352	Right.
SLUGHORN	353	To Hogwarts’ best and brightest!
CORMAC	354	Here, here!
NEVILLE	355	Which one do I use for the soup?
SLUGHORN	356	So tell me, Cormac. See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days?
CORMAC	357	Yes, sir. In fact, I’m meant to
SLUGHORN	358	Well, be sure to give them both my best. What about your uncle, Belby? Working on anything new?
SLUGHORN	359	And you, Miss Granger? What is it your family does in the Muggle world?
HERMIONE	360	My parents are dentists. They tend to people’s teeth.
SLUGHORN	361	Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?
HERMIONE	362	No. Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches. As Slughorn nods, the door GROANS. Everyone turns.
SLUGHORN	363	Miss Weasley! Come in, come in.
GINNY	364	Sorry, I’m not ordinarily late --
SLUGHORN	365	No matter. You’ll be just in time for dessert. That is -- if Belby leaves you any.
HARRY	366	What?
HERMIONE	367	Nothing.
SLUGHORN	368	Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening. We’ll have to do it again. Slughorn closes the door, turns, sends a FLOOR LAMP WOBBLING and, catching it, finds Harry.
SLUGHORN	369	Oh. Potter.
HARRY	370	Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass.
SLUGHORN	371	Ah, yes. A most intriguing object. The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation. When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not...
HARRY	372	I think I’ll be going.
SLUGHORN	373	Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, m’boy. As for some of your classmates, well, let’s just say,
SLUGHORN	374	Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. Then * again... you are already someone aren’t you, Harry?
HARRY	375	I don’t really know how to answer that, sir.
SLUGHORN	376	Your mother was modest too. Your father not so much. As you can
HARRY	377	Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
HARRY	378	You knew him, didn’t you, sir?
HARRY	379	I’m sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents, you see... Harry stops, frowns. Slughorn turns, studies Harry. Nods.
SLUGHORN	380	Of course. It’s only natural that you should want to know more. I’m afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr.
CLOSE ON THE HOURGLASS	381	Nary a grain trickles through.
NEVILLE	382	Good luck, eh, Ron?
SEAMUS	383	Counting on you, Ron. I’ve two Galleons on Gryffindor.
RON	384	So. How was it?
HERMIONE	385	How was what?
HERMIONE	386	Dead boring. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
HERMIONE	387	Ol’ Sluggy’s having a Christmas do, you know. And we’re meant to bring someone...
RON	388	I expect you’ll be going with
HERMIONE	389	Actually, I was going to ask you.
RON	390	Really?
HERMIONE	391	Really. But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
RON	392	I’m resigning. After today’s match. McLaggen can have my spot.
HARRY	393	Have it your way. Juice?
RON	394	Sure... As Harry pours, Luna arrives at the table wearing a HAT that bears an uncanny resemblance to a real lion.
LUNA	395	Hello, everyone. You look dreadful, Ron.
LUNA	396	Is that why you just put something
HERMIONE	397	Don’t drink that, Ron! But Ron’s frozen in mid-sip, looking at Harry’s palm too.
HERMIONE	398	You could be expelled for that.
HARRY	399	Dunno what you’re talking about. Harry pockets the vial, winks at Luna. Ron rises.
RON	400	C’mon, Harry. We’ve got a game to win. CLOSEUP - QUAFFLE As it ROCKETS into the AIR...
DEAN	401	Ginny! Let’s go!
CROWD	402	Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
HERMIONE	403	You shouldn’t have done it, Harry.
HARRY	404	Yeah. I suppose I could’ve just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?
HERMIONE	405	You didn’t put it in?
HERMIONE	406	Charms spell. Just practicing.
LAVENDER BROWN	407	Oops. I think this room’s taken.
RON	408	What’s with the birds?
HERMIONE	409	Oppugno! Instantly the birds race like angry red bullets toward Ron, who flees, SLAMMING SHUT the door.
HARRY	410	It feels like this.
RON	411	Look, I can’t help it if she’s got
HARRY	412	Have you?
HERMIONE	413	Yes. Why?
HARRY	414	I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we’d really like... maybe we’d go together. As friends.
HARRY	415	So who are you taking?
HARRY	416	Really...? Harry considers a fine-boned GIRL with RAVEN HAIR
HARRY	417	But I am the Chosen One.
HARRY	418	Okay. Kidding. I’ll just ask someone I like. Someone cool. HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 71.
LUNA	419	I’ve never been to this part of
NIGHT	420	In the f.g., the BIRDCAGE glimmers dully in the gray moonlight streaming through a window. Within, the TWO BIRDS huddle quietly. We RACK FOCUS and see, THROUGH the grid of wire, a FIGURE APPROACHING. Draco moves down the corridor, eyes fixed oddly ahead.
SLUGHORN	421	Thank you, Adrian!
HARRY	422	Neville...?
NEVILLE	423	I didn’t make the cut for the Slug
ELDRED WORPLE	424	Lovegood, did you say? I once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing. Claimed to run a magazine...
HARRY	425	And what’s happened to you?
HERMIONE	426	Hm? Oh, I’ve just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac. Under the mistletoe.
HARRY	427	Cormac! That’s who you invited!
HERMIONE	428	I thought it would annoy Ron most.
HERMIONE	429	No thank you.
HARRY	430	I think she went to powder her nose. Harry looks past Cormac’s shoulder, out past the hanging and sees Slughorn laughing with a guest. Cormac plucks a dragon blob off the tray in Harry’s hand, pops it.
CORMAC	431	Slippery little minx, your friend.
HARRY	432	Dragon balls. As Cormac’s face freezes, Harry starts to head toward
SNAPE	433	What’s going on back here?
SNAPE	434	You’ve just bought yourself a month’s detention, McLaggen. McLaggen dashes off. Harry makes to follow.
SNAPE	435	Not so quick, Potter.
HARRY	436	I think I should rejoin the party, sir. My date...
SNAPE	437	... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
HARRY	438	Traveling? Where?
FILCH	439	Professor Slughorn, sir! I’ve just discovered this boy lurking
MALFOY	440	Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?
SNAPE	441	I’ll escort him out.
MALFOY	442	Certainly... Professor.
SNAPE	443	I swore to protect you. I made
MALFOY	444	I don’t need protection. I was chosen for this! Out of all others. Me! And I won’t fail
SNAPE	445	You’re afraid, Draco. You attempt to conceal it, but it’s obvious. Let me assist you --
MALFOY	446	No! I was chosen. This is my moment! Malfoy exits. Then Snape.
RON	447	Unbreakable Vow. You’re sure that’s what Snape said.
HARRY	448	Positive. Why?
RON	449	It’s just, well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow.
HARRY	450	I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.
RON	451	No, you don’t understand -- Oh, bloody hell...
HARRY	452	Lovely.
HARRY	453	I’ll take your word for it.
HARRY	454	So what happens? If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
RON	455	You die.
MRS. WEASLEY	456	Eat up, eat up, everyone! There’s more to come!
HARRY	457	Draco’s plotting something, I know it, something to do with
LUPIN	458	Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
HARRY	459	I know it sounds mad --
LUPIN	460	Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending
HARRY	461	That’s not what it sounded like.
TONKS	462	Perhaps Harry’s right, Remus. To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --
LUPIN	463	It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgement. He trusts Snape. Therefore, I do.
HARRY	464	But Dumbledore can make mistakes.
LUPIN	465	You’re blinded by hatred.
HARRY	466	I’m not --
GINNY	467	Open up, you.
GINNY	468	Don’t trust me?
HARRY	469	It’s good.
MR. WEASLEY	470	You’ll have to forgive Remus. It
MR. WEASLEY	471	We’re being followed, all of us. Molly doesn’t leave the house most days. It’s not been easy.
MR. WEASLEY	472	Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person. If Dumbledore’s traveling, it’s news to the Ministry. But perhaps that’s the way Dumbledore wants it. As for Draco Malfoy -- I know
HARRY	473	Go on.
MR. WEASLEY	474	I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes. From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the
MR. WEASLEY	475	They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour
HARRY	476	What happened to it? The one at Borgin & Burkes?
MR. WEASLEY	477	Nothing. It’s still there.
MR. WEASLEY	478	Harry. You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around. Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to
TONKS	479	It was delicious, Molly. Really.
MRS. WEASLEY	480	You’re sure you won’t stay?
TONKS	481	No, we should go.
MRS. WEASLEY	482	Remus...?
GINNY	483	Everyone gone to bed?
HARRY	484	Soon.
GINNY	485	I don’t sleep these days. So I wash my hair. Silly, right?
GINNY	486	Happy Christmas, Harry.
TONKS	487	Sweetheart...
LUPIN	488	There’s someone out there. I can
GINNY	489	Oh my god...
MR. WEASLEY	490	Harry, no! Flames race up the porch steps, climb the walls of the
TONKS	491	Remus!
MR. WEASLEY	492	Ginny, stay with your mother!
NEW ANGLE	493	Fred, George, Ron and Arthur fan out, running full-out,
NEW ANGLES	494	Ginny, copper hair gleaming, races through the reeds.
GINNY	495	No, Harry! It’s a trap!
GREYBACK	496	Don’t you smell clean. Just then, a BOLT OF BLUE bursts off Greyback’s back and
HERMIONE	497	You have to realize who you are, Harry.
HERMIONE	498	So tell me what Arthur said.
HARRY	499	If Dumbledore’s traveling places, it’s news to the Ministry. But get this: that night at Borgin & Burkes? It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.
HERMIONE	500	What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
HARRY	501	You tell me.
HERMIONE	502	He looks different, don’t you think? Draco. Almost... ill.
HARRY	503	Who could tell the difference?
LAVENDER BROWN	504	That’s my Won-Won.
HERMIONE	505	Excuse me, I have to go vomit. As Hermione exits, Harry spies Ginny, in an alcove,
TOM RIDDLE	506	Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
SLUGHORN	507	Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I knew, could I? I must say, m’boy, I’d like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.
TOM RIDDLE	508	Intuition.
SLUGHORN	509	Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention. Lestrange, Avery, don’t forget your essays... As the others file out, Slughorn busies himself with some
SLUGHORN	510	Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want to be caught out of bed after hours...
TOM RIDDLE	511	I know a secret shortcut or two.
SLUGHORN	512	Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom?
TOM RIDDLE	513	Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other
SLUGHORN	514	Go on.
TOM RIDDLE	515	I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me... Suddenly, a DENSE FOG engulfs the room and SLUGHORN’S VOICE twists into an ANGRY SHRIEK:
SLUGHORN	516	I don’t know anything about such things and I wouldn’t tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don’t ever let me catch you mentioning it again!
DUMBLEDORE	517	Confused? I would be surprised if you weren’t.
HARRY	518	I don’t understand -- what happened?
DUMBLEDORE	519	This is perhaps the most important memory I’ve collected. It’s also
DUMBLEDORE	520	I suspect he is ashamed of it.
HARRY	521	Why?
DUMBLEDORE	522	Why indeed.
DUMBLEDORE	523	I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you’ve done so.
HARRY	524	I don’t know him that well, sir --
DUMBLEDORE	525	You’re the Chosen One, Harry. And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances
DUMBLEDORE	526	This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail. As Harry watches, the damp sheen enveloping Dumbledore’s
SLUGHORN	527	Now don’t forget to look over the chapter on antidotes. I’ll be poisoning one of you next time we meet. I’m joking! Off you go! Don’t forget your rattails, Miss Alys. As the tiny ones scurry out, Harry is revealed, waiting
SLUGHORN	528	Ah! If it isn’t the Prince of
HARRY	529	Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.
SLUGHORN	530	Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!
HARRY	531	Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in
SLUGHORN	532	Yes? And exactly what was this rare magic.
HARRY	533	I’m not sure... That is, I don’t recall the name... exactly. But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you’re not allowed to teach?
SLUGHORN	534	I’m a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape.
HARRY	535	Yes, well, we don’t exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is, he’s not like you. He might... misunderstand. Recognition flickers in Slughorn’s eyes. A glint of fear.
SLUGHORN	536	There can be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light. I suggest you do the same.
HARRY	537	Did you say the same to Tom
HARRY	538	Sir --
HERMIONE	539	Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and ask
HARRY	540	Nice.
HARRY	541	Hermione. I think Malfoy’s leaving the castle.
HARRY	542	I’ve seen it. Sometimes...
HERMIONE	543	That’s... not possible. No one can leave the castle these days.
RON	544	It’s beautiful, isn’t it? The moon.
HARRY	545	Divine. Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?
RON	546	It was on your bed. The box. Thought I’d try one...
HARRY	547	Or twenty.
RON	548	I can’t stop thinking about her, Harry.
HARRY	549	Really? Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you.
RON	550	She could never annoy me. I think... I think I love her.
HARRY	551	Excuse me?
HARRY	552	Well... Brilliant.
RON	553	Do you think she knows I exist?
RON	554	Snogging? Who’re you talking about?
HARRY	555	Who’re you talking about?
RON	556	Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.
HARRY	557	Okay. Very funny.
HARRY	558	What the hell was that for?
RON	559	It’s no joke! I’m in love with
HARRY	560	Okay! Fine! You’re in love with her! Have you ever actually met
RON	561	No. Can you introduce me?
RON	562	How do I look?
HARRY	563	Devastatingly handsome. Harry RAPS on the door. FOOTSTEPS -- followed by a LOUD
SLUGHORN	564	Yes???!!!!
HARRY	565	Sir. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t bother you if it weren’t absolutely --
RON	566	Where’s Romilda?
SLUGHORN	567	What’s the matter with Wenby?
SLUGHORN	568	I’d have thought you could whip up
HARRY	569	I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir.
RON	570	Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
SLUGHORN	571	Hm. Perhaps you’re right.
HARRY	572	I’m sorry, sir. About the other day. Our... misunderstanding.
SLUGHORN	573	Yes, well, water under the bridge
HARRY	574	I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of it, after all these years. The questions. About... Voldemort. Slughorn’s mixing hand falters instantly.
SLUGHORN	575	I’ll ask you not to use that name.
HARRY	576	Yes, sir. It’s just, well,
SLUGHORN	577	With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived. Slughorn’s stare is fierce, as fierce as the one
SLUGHORN	578	Alright, m’boy! Bottoms up!
RON	579	What’s this?
RON	580	What happened to me?
HARRY	581	Love potion.
SLUGHORN	582	And a bloody strong one at that.
RON	583	I feel really... bad.
SLUGHORN	584	Pick-me-up’s what you need, m’boy.
SLUGHORN	585	There we are, Potter. To life!
SLUGHORN	586	I d-don’t understand --
HARRY	587	Professor! Do something!!
HARRY	588	Breathe! C’mon, Ron, don’t be a prat. Breathe! BREATHE!
RON	589	These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE	590	Quick thinking on your part, Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?
SLUGHORN	591	Hm? Oh. Yes... very proud. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL I think we all agree that Mr. Potter’s actions were heroic. The question is: Why were they necessary.
DUMBLEDORE	592	Why indeed. Dumbledore takes the half-empty bottle of mead, still bearing a bit of GIFTWRAP.
DUMBLEDORE	593	This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don’t by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.
SLUGHORN	594	Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
DUMBLEDORE	595	To whom might I ask?
SLUGHORN	596	You, Headmaster. Just then -- the DOOR BURSTS OPEN: Lavender Brown.
LAVENDER BROWN	597	Where is he? Where’s my Won-Won!
HERMIONE	598	I might ask you the same.
LAVENDER BROWN	599	I happen to be his girlfriend.
HERMIONE	600	I happen to be his... friend.
LAVENDER BROWN	601	Don’t make me laugh. You haven’t spoken in weeks. I suppose you
HERMIONE	602	He’s been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I’ve
LAVENDER BROWN	603	Ha! See? He senses my presence. I’m here, Won-Won. I’m here --
RON	604	Er... My... Nee... Er! My! Nee! Ron, in a haze, reaches out blindly. Blushing, Hermione
DUMBLEDORE	605	Ah, to be young and feel love’s keen sting. Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended. As Dumbledore leads the others past Harry, Harry studies
GINNY	606	‘Bout time, don’t you think?
SLUGHORN	607	I’ve always cherished my students. They’re my life...
HERMIONE	608	Oh shut up.
HERMIONE	609	Ron. Stop. You’re making it snow.
RON	610	Huh? Ron looks up, sees that it is SNOWING exclusively over
RON	611	Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
HERMIONE	612	Um, well, she came to visit you in
RON	613	Don’t get me wrong. I’m bloody
HERMIONE	614	Does, doesn’t she? And you say you don’t remember a thing from that night? Not one thing?
RON	615	Well... there is... something.
HERMIONE	616	Right. Boggled... Hermione slumps back, frowning. Harry smiles with
HERMIONE	617	That’s Katie. That’s Katie Bell.
HARRY	618	How are you, Katie?
KATIE BELL	619	Give me a moment, girls.
KATIE BELL	620	I know you’re going to ask, Harry. But I don’t know who cursed me. I’ve tried to remember. Honestly. But I just... can’t...
MALFOY	621	Cruci--
HARRY	622	SECTUMSEMPRA! BLOOD SPURTS from Malfoy’s face and SCARLET SLASHES OOZE
MALFOY	623	Don’t touch me! Don’t you dare touch me!
GINNY	624	You have to get rid of it. Today.
GINNY	625	Take my hand.
GINNY	626	Over the years, if someone had a
HARRY	627	Who showed you this? First.
GINNY	628	See, you never know what you’ll find up here.
GINNY	629	All right. Close your eyes. That way you can’t be tempted.
GINNY	630	There’s something else. Another secret of sorts. One of mine...
GINNY	631	That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.
HARRY	632	What?
RON	633	You know. Hide the book.
HARRY	634	Oh. Yeah. Just then, Slughorn rounds the far end of the corridor and -- spying Harry -- does a little Oliver Hardy “Oops” and retreats.
RON	635	Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?
HARRY	636	Say that again.
HERMIONE	637	Well? How do you feel?
HARRY	638	Excellent. Really excellent.
HERMIONE	639	Now remember. Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and
HARRY	640	Right. I’m going down to Hagrid’s.
HERMIONE	641	What? No, Harry -- you’ve got to go see Slughorn. We have a plan --
HARRY	642	No. I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s. I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, know what I mean? HERMIONE/RON No.
HARRY	643	Trust me. I know what I’m doing. Or at least Felix does.
SLUGHORN	644	Merlin’s beard, Harry!
HARRY	645	Sorry, sir. I should’ve announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed. You probably feared I was Madam Sprout.
SLUGHORN	646	Well, yes, actually --
HARRY	647	Just the general behavior, sir.
SLUGHORN	648	Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I’m familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all. My own interests are purely academic, of course.
HARRY	649	Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out. Harry gives a little SHIVER of the shoulders, smiles.
SLUGHORN	650	Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?
HARRY	651	Through the front doors, sir. I’m off to Hagrid’s, you see. He’s a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit. So if you don’t mind, I’ll be going.
SLUGHORN	652	Harry!
HARRY	653	Sir?
SLUGHORN	654	It’s nearly nightfall. Surely you realize I can’t allow you to roam
HARRY	655	Well, then by all means come along, sir.
SLUGHORN	656	Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!
HARRY	657	That would be counterproductive, sir.
SLUGHORN	658	And what makes you say that?
HARRY	659	No idea.
SLUGHORN	660	Merlin’s beard... Up ahead, Hagrid sits disconsolately upon a stump. Nearby, Aragog’s massive body lies legs up.
SLUGHORN	661	Is that an actual Acromantula?
HAGRID	662	‘Arry. ‘Orace.
SLUGHORN	663	My god, dear man. How did you ever manage to kill it?
HAGRID	664	Kill ‘im! Me oldest friend, ‘e was!
SLUGHORN	665	I’m sorry, I... (didn’t realize.) *
HAGRID	666	Ah, don’ worry yerself. Yer not alone. Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders. It’s the eyes, I reckon. Unnerve people.
HARRY	667	Not to mention the pincers.
HAGRID	668	I reckon that too... How’d yeh get outta the castle anyways?
HARRY	669	Through the front doors.
SLUGHORN	670	Hagrid. I wouldn’t want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn’t mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits...
HAGRID	671	Don’ suppose it’s doin’ ‘im any good, izzit?
SLUGHORN	672	My thoughts exactly! Always carry
HAGRID	673	Wish yeh coulda seen ‘im in ‘is prime. Magnificent ‘e was. Jus’ magnificent... Hagrid BLINKS wildly, then takes out a handkerchief and SNORTS LOUDLY into it. Slughorn looks up, studies Hagrid’s sorry expression with empathy and steps away.
SLUGHORN	674	Why don’t I say a few words? I
HARRY	675	Oh yeah.
HAGRID	676	Aragog.
HAGRID	677	Tha’ was... tha’ was... beautiful.
HAGRID	678	I had ‘im from an egg, yeh know.
SLUGHORN	679	Sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he’d vanished. Poof.
HAGRID	680	Tha’s odd.
SLUGHORN	681	Isn’t it? That’s life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof.
HAGRID	682	Poof.
HARRY	683	Poof.
SLUGHORN	684	That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?
SLUGHORN	685	But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth?
HAGRID	686	No idea... no idea at all... Thunk! Hagrid’s great shaggy head hits the table.
SLUGHORN	687	It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface. As I watched,
SLUGHORN	688	Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day I found the
SLUGHORN	689	I know what you want. But I can’t give it to you. It will ruin me...
HARRY	690	Do you know why I survived? The
HARRY	691	I’m not afraid of the name, Professor. And I’m not afraid of him. And you shouldn’t be either.
HARRY	692	Professor. I’m going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at. It’s true. I am
HARRY	693	Only I can kill him. But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told
HARRY	694	Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you
SLUGHORN	695	Don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. You don’t know
TOM RIDDLE	696	Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
SLUGHORN	697	Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I knew, could I? I must say, m’boy, I’d like to know where you get your information. More knowledgable than half the staff, you are.
TOM RIDDLE	698	Intuition.
SLUGHORN	699	Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want to be caught out of bed after hours...
TOM RIDDLE	700	I know a secret shortcut or two.
SLUGHORN	701	Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom?
TOM RIDDLE	702	Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other
SLUGHORN	703	Go on.
TOM RIDDLE	704	I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me. It’s called, as I understand it... a Horcrux. Slughorn’s weak smile evaporates altogether.
SLUGHORN	705	Excuse me?
TOM RIDDLE	706	Horcrux. I came across the term while reading and I didn’t fully understand it.
SLUGHORN	707	I’m not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that’s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed.
TOM RIDDLE	708	Yes, sir. Which is why I came to you. I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you.
TOM RIDDLE	709	Yes, I thought it might be something like that. But I don’t understand how that works, sir.
SLUGHORN	710	One splits one’s soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
TOM RIDDLE	711	Protected?
SLUGHORN	712	That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on. In other words, you cannot die. Riddle nods and TURNS AWAY, staring at himself in the
SLUGHORN	713	I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE	714	Murder.
SLUGHORN	715	Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same.
TOM RIDDLE	716	Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once? For instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number --
SLUGHORN	717	Seven! Merlin’s beard, Tom! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces...
TOM RIDDLE	718	Of course, sir. And I promise I’ll not speak of our conversation. It’ll be our little secret... Riddle reaches out then and pinches the FLAME of a candle, killing it. As SMOKE RISES, we -- DISSOLVE INTO:
HARRY	719	Sir --
HARRY	720	Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir? In making a Horcrux?
DUMBLEDORE	721	It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley’s life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this --
HARRY	722	And the ring...?
DUMBLEDORE	723	Belonged to Voldemort’s mother. It was difficult to find and...
HARRY	724	But if you could find them all. * If you did destroy each Horcrux... *
DUMBLEDORE	725	One destroys Voldemort.
HARRY	726	But how would you find them? They * could be hidden anywhere, couldn’t
DUMBLEDORE	727	True. But magic, especially Dark magic...
DUMBLEDORE	728	... leaves traces. Harry’s clenched hand SPASMS, RELEASES. The ring skitters across Dumbledore’s desk and Harry brings a hand
HARRY	729	It’s where you’ve been going, isn’t it, sir? When you leave the school. Harry’s eyes drift once again to the postcard on the
DUMBLEDORE	730	Yes. And I think... perhaps... I may have found another. But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
DUMBLEDORE	731	Once again, I shall ask too much of you.
HERMIONE	732	Harry. It’s time.
HARRY	733	Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?
HERMIONE	734	If one wants it to be. Why?
HARRY	735	It would explain why I thought
HERMIONE	736	Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!
RON	737	No. I got an owl from Dad this * morning. The one at Borgin & Burke’s? It’s still there.
HARRY	738	But I’m telling you. I saw it --
HARRY	739	What if there are two? Vanishing cabinets.
HERMIONE	740	What if there are?
HARRY	741	I don’t know... Harry watches the twins vanish around a corner.
RON	742	Good luck, mate.
HARRY	743	I don’t need luck. I’ll be with Dumbledore.
SNAPE	744	Have you ever considered that you ask too much? That you take too much for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don’t want to do this anymore?
DUMBLEDORE	745	Whether it has or hasn’t is irrelevant. I will not negotiate this with you, Severus. You agreed. There’s nothing more to discuss.
DUMBLEDORE	746	Harry. You need a shave, my friend.
DUMBLEDORE	747	At times I forget how much you’ve grown. At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard.
HARRY	748	You look the same to me, sir.
DUMBLEDORE	749	Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind.
HARRY	750	Yes, sir.
DUMBLEDORE	751	Understand what I’m saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide.
DUMBLEDORE	752	Should I tell you to run, you will * run.
DUMBLEDORE	753	And should I tell you to abandon * me and save yourself... Harry’s eyes rise, meet Dumbledore’s. * DUMBLEDORE * You will do so. *
DUMBLEDORE	754	Your word, Harry.
HARRY	755	My word.
DUMBLEDORE	756	Take my arm.
HARRY	757	Sir, I thought one couldn’t Apparate within Hogwarts.
DUMBLEDORE	758	Being me has its privileges.
HARRY	759	It’s there, isn’t it? HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 121.
DUMBLEDORE	760	This is the place. Oh yes, this place has known magic.
HARRY	761	Sir!
DUMBLEDORE	762	In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder.
HARRY	763	You should’ve let me, sir.
DUMBLEDORE	764	Oh, no, Harry. Your blood is much more precious than mine.
DUMBLEDORE	765	Careful. The water.
DUMBLEDORE	766	It’s there. The only question is how do we get to it?
HARRY	767	We couldn’t, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?
HARRY	768	Accio Horcrux! There is an EXPLOSION and something PALE erupts out of
DUMBLEDORE	769	Perhaps not.
DUMBLEDORE	770	If you would, Harry...
HARRY	771	Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
DUMBLEDORE	772	Only recreationally. You see, I believe one creates one’s own luck.
HARRY	773	Professor... there are bodies in this lake.
DUMBLEDORE	774	Yes.
DUMBLEDORE	775	Remember... the water.
HARRY	776	Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
DUMBLEDORE	777	Oh yes. Dumbledore steps back, ponders the basin. Notes the CRYSTAL GOBLET sitting beside it. Smiles ruefully.
DUMBLEDORE	778	It has to be drunk.
DUMBLEDORE	779	This potion might paralyze me. It might cause me to forget why I’m here. It might create so much pain I beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests, Harry. It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat. Understood?
HARRY	780	Why can’t I drink it, sir?
DUMBLEDORE	781	Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable.
HARRY	782	Professor?
HARRY	783	Professor? Can you hear me?
DUMBLEDORE	784	Don’t... don’t make me...
HARRY	785	You... you can’t stop, Professor. You’ve got to keep drinking. Like you said. Remember.
DUMBLEDORE	786	Nooooooo!!!
DUMBLEDORE	787	Make it stop... Please... make it stop...
HARRY	788	It will, sir. It’ll stop. But only if you drink...
DUMBLEDORE	789	My fault. It’s all my fault...
DUMBLEDORE	790	Too much... I can’t... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!
HARRY	791	What?
DUMBLEDORE	792	Your word, Harry! Your word!
HARRY	793	No...
DUMBLEDORE	794	KILL ME! IT’S THE ONLY WAY!
HARRY	795	One more. Just one more. And then -- I promise... I’ll do what you say. Dumbledore, jaw clinched shut, eyes Harry.
HARRY	796	I promise.
DUMBLEDORE	797	Water.
DUMBLEDORE	798	Water...
HARRY	799	Aguamenti. Instantly COLD CLEAR WATER rises in the basin.
HARRY	800	You did it, sir. Look -- Harry frowns. The goblet is empty.
DUMBLEDORE	801	Water!
HARRY	802	I’m trying, sir. I’m -- Harry stops. All is silent... except for the SOFT
DUMBLEDORE	803	Go...
DUMBLEDORE	804	We have to... go.
HARRY	805	Don’t worry, sir. We’re nearly there.
DUMBLEDORE	806	I am not worried, Harry. I am with you.
HARRY	807	We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --
DUMBLEDORE	808	No. Severus... Severus is who I
HARRY	809	All right. Okay.
HARRY	810	Sir, are you... praying?
DUMBLEDORE	811	Hide yourself below. And do not speak or show yourself without my permission. No matter what.
DUMBLEDORE	812	Do as I say, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE	813	Trust me.
DUMBLEDORE	814	Good evening, Draco. What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening? Or is it Summer? Draco stands poised, wand in hand, eyes darting about.
MALFOY	815	Who else is here? I heard you talking.
DUMBLEDORE	816	I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven’t been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco? Draco eyes Dumbledore with unease.
DUMBLEDORE	817	You are not an assassin, Draco.
MALFOY	818	How do you know what I am? I’ve done things that would shock you.
DUMBLEDORE	819	Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping
MALFOY	820	He trusts me! I was chosen!
DUMBLEDORE	821	Then I shall make it easy for you.
DUMBLEDORE	822	Well done, Draco. But I warn you. * Killing is not nearly as easy. *
DUMBLEDORE	823	You’re not alone. Are you. There are others. How?
DUMBLEDORE	824	That cabinet has been broken for years.
MALFOY	825	I’ve been mending it.
DUMBLEDORE	826	Ingenious. Let me guess. It has
MALFOY	827	I don’t want your help! Don’t you see! I have to do it! I have to!
DUMBLEDORE	828	Say that again, Draco. But aloud this time.
BELLATRIX	829	Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore. Wandless and alone.
DUMBLEDORE	830	Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order.
BELLATRIX	831	Love to, Albus. But I’m afraid we’re on a bit of a tight schedule.
BELLATRIX	832	No! The Dark Lord was clear. The boy’s to do it. Go on, Draco. Now!
DUMBLEDORE	833	Severus...
BELLATRIX	834	Well, look who’s here. Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Come to see the slaughter?
DUMBLEDORE	835	Severus... please.
SNAPE	836	I gave my word. I made a vow... Harry’s eyes dart back and forth frantically, trying to make sense of the scene playing out above. Snape’s arm rises.
SNAPE	837	Avada Kedavra!
SNAPE	838	You can no longer stay here. Draco, stunned, stares at the empty place where
BELLATRIX	839	Boo.
BELLATRIX	840	Draco! Draco!
SNAPE	841	Go on!
SNAPE	842	Go on!
HARRY	843	Cruciatus!
HARRY	844	Incacerata! Once again, Snape deflects the spell.
HARRY	845	Impedimenta!
HARRY	846	Fight! Fight back, you coward! With staggering quickness, Snape’s wand whips forth and
SNAPE	847	Don’t ever associate that word and my name again.
HARRY	848	Sectumsempra! Bang! Snape wheels and once more sends Harry flying onto
SNAPE	849	You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?
SNAPE	850	You may have gotten your mother’s eyes, but you’re as dim as your father. Yes. It’s me. I’m the Half-Blood Prince. Snape kicks Harry’s wand aside and turns away, joining
HARRY	851	Hagrid... HAGRID! Harry races toward the hut when the DOOR flies off its hinges. Seconds later, Hagrid stumbles out, beard
HARRY	852	Hagrid! You alright?
HAGRID	853	Take more’n tha’ ter finish me off. Not sure about me ‘ouse, tho’. But if anybody can put it righ’, Dumbledore can.
HARRY	854	Hagrid, Dumbledore --
HAGRID	855	Only thing I can’t reckon is wha’
HAGRID	856	An’ wha’s this wi’ the Dark Mar’? Who’s been killed?
HARRY	857	Yeah, strange. Only... it’s not. * It’s a fake. * As Hermione reacts, Harry nods. * *
HARRY	858	Go on. Open it. *
HARRY	859	I’m not coming back, Hermione. *
HARRY	860	I have to finish what Dumbledore * started. I’m not sure where that * will lead me... but I’ll let you * and Ron konw where I am -- when I * can. (ALT: I have to finish what *
HERMIONE	861	You don’t honestly think you can * find all those Horcruxes by * yourself, do you? *
HARRY	862	I don’t know. *
