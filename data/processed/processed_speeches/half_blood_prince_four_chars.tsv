SNAPE	9	Run along, Wormtail.
SNAPE	13	If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.
SNAPE	14	As it so happens I’m aware of your situation, Narcissa.
SNAPE	16	Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable.
SNAPE	19	I can’t change the Dark Lord’s mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. To provide some... protection.
SNAPE	21	I can try.
SNAPE	25	Take out your wand.
SNAPE	27	I will.
SNAPE	29	I will.
SNAPE	31	I will.
RON	85	Harry? Did someone say Harry?
RON	86	‘Course not. Think I’d know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn’t I?
HERMIONE	87	Was that an owl I heard?
HERMIONE	88	Really?
RON	92	You’ve a bit of...
RON	94	Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts. That it’s too dangerous.
HERMIONE	96	She’s not alone. Even my parents
HERMIONE	98	There’s been a lot of chatter
HERMIONE	112	These are adorable. Inside a cage, small round BALLS of FLUFF roll about,
RON	113	How much for this?
RON	114	How much for me? FRED/GEORGE Five Galleons.
RON	115	But I’m your brother! FRED/GEORGE Ten Galleons.
RON	116	C’mon. Let’s go.
RON	118	Hi.
HERMIONE	119	How is it Fred and George are doing it? Half the alley’s closed down.
HERMIONE	120	Oh no. Look.
RON	122	Is it just me? Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don’t want to be followed?
HERMIONE	125	Bloody hell.
RON	126	Sorry. Just then, the cauldron EXPLODES with light. Instantly,
HERMIONE	128	I don’t know.
HERMIONE	133	Stop, Harry, I know where you’re going with this --
RON	134	One of what?
RON	135	You’re barking. What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
HERMIONE	136	I told you. I don’t know what I saw.
HERMIONE	144	Where’s Harry?
RON	145	Probably on the platform. C’mon.
SNAPE	164	It’s alright, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy. Draco eyes Snape warily again, then begins to slouch off, catches Harry looking.
RON	174	Don’ you worry. He’ll be ‘long soon ‘nuff --
RON	175	Oi! Turn around, you lunatic.
RON	186	But I don’t want to take Potions!
RON	187	Ron Weasley, sir. But I’m dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --
HERMIONE	192	Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. And that... In the cupboard, Harry and Ron find two TEXTBOOKS -- one new, one shabby and soiled. Both snatch for the new when
HERMIONE	193	... is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world.
HERMIONE	199	Liquid luck.
HERMIONE	207	How did you do that?
HERMIONE	209	No. The instructions specifically say to cut.
HERMIONE	211	Sh!
RON	272	Hard feelings?
RON	274	Really? Strapping guy like you, you’ve got a Beater’s build, don’t you think? Keeper needs to be agile, quick --
RON	279	Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one. Hope Cormac’s not taking it too hard.
RON	280	Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.
HERMIONE	282	No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
RON	283	What?
HERMIONE	284	I’d like to know just whose book that was. Let’s take a look, shall we?
HERMIONE	288	For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?
HERMIONE	290	Well, I was curious. So I went to -- HARRY/RON
HERMIONE	292	And... nothing. There’s no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
HERMIONE	295	What’ve you got there, Hagrid?
HERMIONE	297	Stinksap? You’re not sick, are you?
RON	299	Spider? About six feet tall? Ten feet wide?
RON	305	O-kay.
HERMIONE	307	Three Butterbeers. Splash of ginger in mine, please.
RON	308	Aw, bloody hell...
RON	309	I’d like to leave.
HERMIONE	310	Leave? You can’t be serious.
RON	311	That happens to be my sister.
HERMIONE	320	Be delighted, sir.
RON	322	What’re you playing at?
RON	324	Um... You’ve got a little...
RON	325	Bit worried about her. Did you
HERMIONE	326	What’s up? At that very instant, Katie Bell RISES SIX FEET INTO THE
HERMIONE	328	I’ll get someone --
RON	334	Believe me, Professor, I’ve been asking myself the same question for six years. Just then, Snape appears at the door, eyes the trio. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Severus.
SNAPE	335	Is this it?
SNAPE	336	I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
SNAPE	339	Indeed. Your evidence?
SNAPE	341	You... just... know. Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
RON	342	What do you suppose Dean sees in
RON	345	Attractive?
RON	347	Skin? You’re saying Dean’s dating my sister because of her skin?
RON	349	Hermione’s got nice skin. Wouldn’t you say? As skin goes, I mean.
RON	352	Right.
HERMIONE	360	My parents are dentists. They tend to people’s teeth.
HERMIONE	362	No. Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches. As Slughorn nods, the door GROANS. Everyone turns.
HERMIONE	367	Nothing.
RON	384	So. How was it?
HERMIONE	385	How was what?
HERMIONE	386	Dead boring. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
HERMIONE	387	Ol’ Sluggy’s having a Christmas do, you know. And we’re meant to bring someone...
RON	388	I expect you’ll be going with
HERMIONE	389	Actually, I was going to ask you.
RON	390	Really?
HERMIONE	391	Really. But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
RON	392	I’m resigning. After today’s match. McLaggen can have my spot.
RON	394	Sure... As Harry pours, Luna arrives at the table wearing a HAT that bears an uncanny resemblance to a real lion.
HERMIONE	397	Don’t drink that, Ron! But Ron’s frozen in mid-sip, looking at Harry’s palm too.
HERMIONE	398	You could be expelled for that.
RON	400	C’mon, Harry. We’ve got a game to win. CLOSEUP - QUAFFLE As it ROCKETS into the AIR...
HERMIONE	403	You shouldn’t have done it, Harry.
HERMIONE	405	You didn’t put it in?
HERMIONE	406	Charms spell. Just practicing.
RON	408	What’s with the birds?
HERMIONE	409	Oppugno! Instantly the birds race like angry red bullets toward Ron, who flees, SLAMMING SHUT the door.
RON	411	Look, I can’t help it if she’s got
HERMIONE	413	Yes. Why?
HERMIONE	426	Hm? Oh, I’ve just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac. Under the mistletoe.
HERMIONE	428	I thought it would annoy Ron most.
HERMIONE	429	No thank you.
SNAPE	433	What’s going on back here?
SNAPE	434	You’ve just bought yourself a month’s detention, McLaggen. McLaggen dashes off. Harry makes to follow.
SNAPE	435	Not so quick, Potter.
SNAPE	437	... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
SNAPE	441	I’ll escort him out.
SNAPE	443	I swore to protect you. I made
SNAPE	445	You’re afraid, Draco. You attempt to conceal it, but it’s obvious. Let me assist you --
RON	447	Unbreakable Vow. You’re sure that’s what Snape said.
RON	449	It’s just, well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow.
RON	451	No, you don’t understand -- Oh, bloody hell...
RON	455	You die.
HERMIONE	497	You have to realize who you are, Harry.
HERMIONE	498	So tell me what Arthur said.
HERMIONE	500	What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
HERMIONE	502	He looks different, don’t you think? Draco. Almost... ill.
HERMIONE	505	Excuse me, I have to go vomit. As Hermione exits, Harry spies Ginny, in an alcove,
HERMIONE	539	Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and ask
HERMIONE	543	That’s... not possible. No one can leave the castle these days.
RON	544	It’s beautiful, isn’t it? The moon.
RON	546	It was on your bed. The box. Thought I’d try one...
RON	548	I can’t stop thinking about her, Harry.
RON	550	She could never annoy me. I think... I think I love her.
RON	553	Do you think she knows I exist?
RON	554	Snogging? Who’re you talking about?
RON	556	Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.
RON	559	It’s no joke! I’m in love with
RON	561	No. Can you introduce me?
RON	562	How do I look?
RON	566	Where’s Romilda?
RON	570	Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
RON	579	What’s this?
RON	580	What happened to me?
RON	583	I feel really... bad.
RON	589	These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.
HERMIONE	598	I might ask you the same.
HERMIONE	600	I happen to be his... friend.
HERMIONE	602	He’s been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I’ve
RON	604	Er... My... Nee... Er! My! Nee! Ron, in a haze, reaches out blindly. Blushing, Hermione
HERMIONE	608	Oh shut up.
HERMIONE	609	Ron. Stop. You’re making it snow.
RON	610	Huh? Ron looks up, sees that it is SNOWING exclusively over
RON	611	Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
HERMIONE	612	Um, well, she came to visit you in
RON	613	Don’t get me wrong. I’m bloody
HERMIONE	614	Does, doesn’t she? And you say you don’t remember a thing from that night? Not one thing?
RON	615	Well... there is... something.
HERMIONE	616	Right. Boggled... Hermione slumps back, frowning. Harry smiles with
HERMIONE	617	That’s Katie. That’s Katie Bell.
RON	633	You know. Hide the book.
RON	635	Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?
HERMIONE	637	Well? How do you feel?
HERMIONE	639	Now remember. Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and
HERMIONE	641	What? No, Harry -- you’ve got to go see Slughorn. We have a plan --
HERMIONE	732	Harry. It’s time.
HERMIONE	734	If one wants it to be. Why?
HERMIONE	736	Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!
RON	737	No. I got an owl from Dad this * morning. The one at Borgin & Burke’s? It’s still there.
HERMIONE	740	What if there are?
RON	742	Good luck, mate.
SNAPE	744	Have you ever considered that you ask too much? That you take too much for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don’t want to do this anymore?
SNAPE	836	I gave my word. I made a vow... Harry’s eyes dart back and forth frantically, trying to make sense of the scene playing out above. Snape’s arm rises.
SNAPE	837	Avada Kedavra!
SNAPE	838	You can no longer stay here. Draco, stunned, stares at the empty place where
SNAPE	841	Go on!
SNAPE	842	Go on!
SNAPE	847	Don’t ever associate that word and my name again.
SNAPE	849	You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?
SNAPE	850	You may have gotten your mother’s eyes, but you’re as dim as your father. Yes. It’s me. I’m the Half-Blood Prince. Snape kicks Harry’s wand aside and turns away, joining
HERMIONE	861	You don’t honestly think you can * find all those Horcruxes by * yourself, do you? *
