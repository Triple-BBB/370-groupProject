HERMIONE	3	"Coming, Mum."
HERMIONE	9	Obliviate.
HERMIONE	10	Goodbye.
RON	11	What are those?
RON	14	C’mon. Mum’s got dinner ready.
VOLDEMORT	15	Severus. I was beginning to worry you’d lost your way. Come. I’ve saved you a seat.
VOLDEMORT	16	"You know our hosts, of course, Severus. Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable. Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence. Are you, Lucius?"
VOLDEMORT	18	Are you burdened?
VOLDEMORT	20	"You bring news I trust, Severus?"
SNAPE	21	It will happen Saturday next. At nightfall.
VOLDEMORT	22	And this information comes --
SNAPE	23	from the source we discussed.
SNAPE	25	This is a false trail. The Auror Office no longer plays any part in
VOLDEMORT	26	"Pius, what say you?"
VOLDEMORT	28	"Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most"
SNAPE	29	"To a safehouse. Likely the home of someone in the Order. I’m told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him. We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who"
VOLDEMORT	31	Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
VOLDEMORT	33	"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be"
VOLDEMORT	34	"Come now. Surely one of you would like the honor? What about... you, Lucius?"
VOLDEMORT	35	I require your wand.
VOLDEMORT	36	Do I detect elm?
VOLDEMORT	38	And the core?
VOLDEMORT	40	My wand? You can’t possibly think I would give you my wand.
VOLDEMORT	42	"For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss"
VOLDEMORT	44	Avada Kedavra!
VOLDEMORT	45	Nagini... Dinner.
RON	73	"Never done that before, have we?"
VOLDEMORT	93	Avada..
RON	112	Hey ya -- Well... thanks.
HERMIONE	113	Really?
VOLDEMONT	131	Then explain this!
VOLDEMORT	133	"Perhaps our friend’s loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail."
VOLDEMONT	135	"I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake. I won’t be so forgiving next time..."
RON	137	For you? You think Madeye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be
RON	139	And leave Hermione? Are you mad? We wouldn’t last two days without
RON	142	"Tonight’s not the night, mate. You’d only be doing him a favor."
RON	143	Do you think he knows?
RON	144	"I mean, they’re bits of his soul,"
RON	145	"What I’m saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy"
RON	161	Dumbledore? And me? I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley
HERMIONE	163	"We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --"
RON	169	Dumbledore left this? For me? Brilliant. Er -- what is it? 
RON	170	Wicked.
RON	172	"Mum used to read me those! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,"
RON	173	"Oh, c’mon! Beedle’s stories are famous! Babbity Rabbitty? No...?"
HERMIONE	177	To Harry! It belongs to Harry!
HERMIONE	181	"Where is your guard, sir?"
HERMIONE	218	Ron! Ron!
RON	220	Where are we?
HERMIONE	221	Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad. Just popped into my head. I don’t know why...
HERMIONE	222	This way!
HERMIONE	223	We need to change.
RON	224	How the ruddy --
HERMIONE	225	Undetectable Extension Charm.
RON	226	"You’re amazing, you are."
HERMIONE	227	Always the tone of surprise.
HERMIONE	228	That’ll be the books.
RON	230	"They were after you, mate. We’d just put everyone in danger going back."
HERMIONE	231	"Ron’s right. Cappuccino, please. "
HERMIONE	234	"Too dangerous. If Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, none of"
HERMIONE	237	I’ve had the essentials packed for days. Just in case.
RON	238	By the way -- these jeans? Not my favorite. Bit tight.
HERMIONE	241	Petrificus Totalus!
HERMIONE	242	Go.
RON	244	This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.
RON	245	"So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn’t you?"
RON	247	You’re the boss.
RON	248	You’re the best with spells.
HERMIONE	249	Obliviate. 
HERMIONE	251	Maybe you still have the Trace on you.
RON	252	Can’t be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It’s Wizarding law.
RON	253	What?
HERMIONE	254	"We didn’t celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I -- we’d prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding..."
HERMIONE	256	Right. Perspective.
RON	257	"We’ve got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe."
RON	260	What was that about?
HERMIONE	261	"Mad-eye’s doing, I’d guess. In case Snape decided to come snooping."
HERMIONE	262	Homenum revelio.
HERMIONE	263	It’s a spell to reveal human presence.
HERMIONE	264	We’re alone.
HERMIONE	266	Ron! I’ve found him!
HERMIONE	267	"Harry, you can’t just disappear. We thought --"
HERMIONE	268	It’s from your Mum. To Sirius.
HERMIONE	270	"Harry. I can imagine why you’d want to go there, but... I don’t think Bathilda Bagshot is going to"
HERMIONE	271	Lovely.
HERMIONE	272	Regulus Arcturus Black...?
RON	273	R... A... B.
RON	275	R.A.B. was Sirius’ brother? 
RON	276	Kreacher...
HERMIONE	285	But was it here? Did you ever see it?
HERMIONE	287	"Ron! RON! Reluctantly, Ron releases the elf."
HERMIONE	297	Expelliarmus! Mundungus’ wand soars into the air... into Hermione’s hand.
RON	303	"You’re a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it. "
RON	305	Wicked trainers.
HERMIONE	307	Stop lying! Hermione begins to move toward Mundungus. Ron reaches
RON	308	Piece of advice. Let’s not rehash old times. Got it... mate?
HERMIONE	311	You’ve still got it.
RON	313	Right. So let’s do it. Who gets * who? *
HERMIONE	315	"Completely, utterly, without question."
HERMIONE	344	Relashio!
HERMIONE	346	Harry... they’ve seen you. We’ve got to get out of here.
RON	348	Long story. Nice meeting you.
RON	349	Piss off.
HERMIONE	351	"Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany.’"
HERMIONE	352	Quickly!
HERMIONE	354	"Unstopper it. Hermione rips open Ron’s shirt, which is soaked in blood."
HERMIONE	355	Just do it!
HERMIONE	357	We were. We were there. But
HERMIONE	359	It’s all I feel safe doing.
HERMIONE	360	Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
HERMIONE	362	"Protective enchantments. I don’t fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent..."
HERMIONE	364	Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...
HERMIONE	365	How’re the mushrooms? Seem to be
HERMIONE	366	Make sure to leave some for Ron.
HERMIONE	367	So where do we go next?
HERMIONE	368	"It scares me a bit, that, thinking it’s a piece of Vol--"
RON	369	"No, don’t! Don’t say it!"
RON	370	It’s taboo -- You-Know-Who’s name.
RON	372	"I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry. Blimey, what’s that smell?"
RON	373	Not bloody likely. Smells like something Ginny would cook.
HERMIONE	374	Tea?
RON	375	Is that it?
RON	377	... alive.
HERMIONE	378	I hate it. It’s like he’s here with us.
HERMIONE	381	Incendio! 
HERMIONE	383	Confringo!
RON	384	It’s angry.
HERMIONE	385	What’re you doing?
HERMIONE	387	I can put it in my bag --
RON	389	"Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn’t bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn’t that bother you?"
VOLDEMORT	391	"You wouldn’t be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch? Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you... "
VOLDEMORT	393	I believe you... 
HERMIONE	394	I thought it had stopped.
HERMIONE	395	"You can’t let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it. You have to close your mind. It’s too dangerous --"
HERMIONE	397	Tell me. What you saw.
HERMIONE	402	I think he just hopes he doesn’t
HERMIONE	404	"We’ve all made sacrifices, Harry."
HERMIONE	405	I don’t know. It takes time. I’m doing all I can.
HERMIONE	407	Take it off.
HERMIONE	408	Take it off. Now.
HERMIONE	409	Better?
HERMIONE	411	It’s cold. Even though it’s been lying against your skin for days.
HERMIONE	412	We’ll take turns. Okay?
HERMIONE	415	He could smell it. My perfume.
HERMIONE	417	I told you. Ron’s not strong enough to Apparate.
RON	419	I’m hungry.
RON	421	I’m hungry.
RON	423	Leave it.
RON	424	Mum can make food appear out of thin air.
RON	425	I said leave it.
HERMIONE	427	Good plan.
RON	428	"Yeah. Brilliant. Only, correct me if I’m wrong... wasn’t that yesterday’s plan? And the day before that? And the day before that? Walk. Sleep. Walk. Sleep."
HERMIONE	430	None of us do.
RON	431	Wizards were here.
HERMIONE	432	I don’t like this place.
HERMIONE	433	I want to go.
HERMIONE	435	Oh my god...
HERMIONE	436	I’ll tell you in a minute.
HERMIONE	438	Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor? It’s Goblin made.
HERMIONE	440	You don’t understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.
HERMIONE	442	"Harry. You already destroyed one Horcrux, right? Tom Riddle’s diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets."
HERMIONE	444	"Don’t you see! In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor."
HERMIONE	446	Exactly! Which means...
HERMIONE	448	Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.
HERMIONE	450	"Actually, I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook."
RON	452	"Yeah, I’m still here. But you two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun."
RON	454	"Problem? There’s no problem. Not according to you, anyway."
RON	457	"Yeah, I thought I did too."
RON	459	"No, I just reckoned after all this time, we’d have actually achieved something. I reckoned you knew what you were doing. I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!"
RON	461	"Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to"
HERMIONE	462	"Take it off, Ron. Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it"
HERMIONE	464	"Harry, we weren’t --"
RON	465	"Don’t lie! You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --"
HERMIONE	466	I didn’t! Not like that! Harry -- I didn’t!
RON	467	"Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night? Do you! To make sure I don’t hear Ginny’s name or Fred or George or Mum or --"
RON	469	NO! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE! YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!
HERMIONE	470	Stop! Stop!
RON	472	And you?
HERMIONE	473	Me?
RON	474	Are you staying? Or coming?
RON	475	Fine. I get it. I saw you two
HERMIONE	476	"What? Ron, no -- please --"
HERMIONE	478	It’s a Muggle station. 
HERMIONE	481	‘I open at the close?’
HERMIONE	483	"I don’t know. But look, I’ve found something as well..."
HERMIONE	484	"I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don’t think it is. It isn’t a rune and it’s not in Spellman’s Syllabary either. And it’s been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn’t part of the book."
HERMIONE	486	What d’you mean -- wearing it?
HERMIONE	487	Why would someone have drawn it in a children’s book?
HERMIONE	489	And it’s exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.
HERMIONE	490	"It’s dangerous, Harry. But I have to admit, recently even I’ve been thinking we might have to go. I think it’s possible something else is hidden there."
HERMIONE	493	Don’t ever let me give you a haircut again.
HERMIONE	494	I still think we should’ve used Polyjuice Potion.
HERMIONE	496	"Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve! Listen..."
HERMIONE	498	Yeah. I think they would.
HERMIONE	499	Harry.
HERMIONE	501	No. But look.
HERMIONE	502	Did you know he had a sister?
HERMIONE	504	Lumos.
HERMIONE	505	"Ignotus... Hey, Har --"
HERMIONE	508	"Happy Christmas, Harry."
HERMIONE	509	Harry...
HERMIONE	511	Someone’s watching us. By the gate.
HERMIONE	513	I don’t think this is a good idea.
HERMIONE	515	Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave.
HERMIONE	517	Omigod. Harry...
HERMIONE	519	"Harry, I’m not sure about this."
HERMIONE	521	"You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot."
HERMIONE	526	Why?
HERMIONE	528	Harry...
HERMIONE	530	"Confringo! As Hermione’s spell caroms off the trembling walls, we"
HERMIONE	531	"Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney,"
HERMIONE	532	"Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old."
HERMIONE	533	You wanted to know who the boy in
HERMIONE	534	It was in Bathilda’s sitting room.
HERMIONE	535	Yes.
HERMIONE	537	For a time.
HERMIONE	540	Wizard rule over Muggles.
HERMIONE	542	Yes.
HERMIONE	544	It was something Dumbledore came up with. He believed wizards were superior and should rule over
HERMIONE	545	"It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer. Dumbledore was"
HERMIONE	549	"It’s my fault. As we were leaving Godric’s Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I’m sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --"
HERMIONE	551	Maybe we can --
HERMIONE	554	"He loved you, Harry. I know he loved you."
RON	560	Are -- you -- mental? 
RON	562	"Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I'd think."
RON	564	No. I reckoned it was you.
RON	566	Right. Antlers.
RON	568	"No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --"
RON	569	Anything?
RON	570	"And we did, didn’t we?"
RON	572	"What? No. Harry. That thing’s bad for me. I can’t handle it. I’m not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione. It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse."
RON	573	No. I can’t --
RON	584	I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left.
RON	586	Saving your life.
RON	588	And just think of it. Only three to go.
HERMIONE	589	Everything all right?
RON	591	Hey.
RON	592	Wo -- hey -- ouch!
HERMIONE	594	Never mind why he’s got my wand --
HERMIONE	595	You destroyed it?
HERMIONE	596	And exactly how is it you have the Sword of Gryffindor?
HERMIONE	598	Don’t think this changes anything.
RON	599	"No, of course not. I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux! Why would that change anything! Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you! To see you doing those things --"
HERMIONE	600	See me doing what things?
HERMIONE	601	What happened out there?
RON	602	"Look, I wanted to come back the minute I’d left. I just... didn’t know how to find you."
RON	604	With this.
RON	605	"It doesn’t just turn off lights. I don’t know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I’d given some Snatchers the slip"
RON	607	A voice. 
RON	608	"Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of this."
HERMIONE	609	And what may I ask did I say?
RON	610	My name. Just my name. Like a whisper.
RON	611	So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew.
RON	613	"Just knew. On account of Hermione’s voice. And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here."
RON	614	"I could feel it inside me. It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea. And I knew it would take me where I needed to go."
RON	615	I’ve always liked it. These flames Hermione makes.
RON	616	How long you reckon she’ll stay mad at me?
RON	618	It was true. Every word.
RON	619	"Bloody hell. I just realized. You need a wand, right?"
RON	621	"Well, I’ve got one. Here. It’s Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it’ll do. I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back."
RON	623	Wo.
HERMIONE	625	What’s going on in there? 
HARRY/RON	625	Nothing.
HERMIONE	626	We need to talk.
HERMIONE	628	See this? It’s a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature. It’s the mark again. 
HERMIONE	629	It keeps cropping up. Here. In Beedle the Bard. In the graveyard in Godric’s Hollow -- what?
HERMIONE	631	Where?
RON	633	But what does it mean?
HERMIONE	634	"Harry, you don’t have a clue where"
RON	635	I think Hermione’s right. I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it? Those in favor...
RON	636	"Sorry, Harry. Looks like it’s"
HERMIONE	638	I’m always mad at him.
RON	639	Luna?
RON	640	Keep off the dirigible plums.
RON	647	Aren’t you the one who keeps
HERMIONE	650	Do you see that?
RON	651	"Well, yeah, of course. It’s massive, isn’t it?"
HERMIONE	652	No! Don’t go near it!
HERMIONE	653	It’s an Erumpent horn. It’s a Class B Tradeable Material.
RON	654	"Yeah, all right... "
HERMIONE	656	"Where is Luna, sir?"
HERMIONE	661	It’s in here.
HERMIONE	663	Granger. Well... all right.
RON	664	Midnight. Mum always said midnight.
HERMIONE	669	"It’s obvious, isn’t it?"
RON	670	"You’re supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible. Dead boring if you ask me. But an unbeatable wand!"
HERMIONE	671	Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.
RON	672	"Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you’d lead."
HERMIONE	675	There have always been Cloaks --
RON	676	Not like Harry’s. I’ve seen a fair few. Dad used to bring home
RON	678	You forgot the water.
RON	679	For the tea.
HERMIONE	681	"No matter, sir. We really ought to be go--"
RON	686	Nooooooooo! 
HERMIONE	688	Ron! Harry! Take my hand!
RON	689	That treacherous old bleeder! Is there no one we can trust!
RON	690	I’ll do the enchantments.
VOLDEMORT	694	"If not you, then who?"
VOLDEMORT	696	"Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where to find it! Tell me who possesses it! The name, Grindelwald! The name!"
HERMIONE	698	What’re you saying?
HERMIONE	700	Stop it!
RON	706	Stan Shunpike.
RON	708	Weasley...
RON	710	Piss off! Arthur Weasley’s ten times the wizard you are!
HERMIONE	713	Penelope Clearwater. Half-blood.
HERMIONE	719	A Stinging Jinx.
HERMIONE	721	Not long.
