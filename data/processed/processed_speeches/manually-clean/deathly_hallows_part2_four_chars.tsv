HERMIONE	2	A Stinging Jinx.
HERMIONE	4	Not long.
RON	30	Harry! What’re we going to do? We can’t just leave Hermione alone
HERMIONE	33	I don’t know what you’re talking about.
RON	37	"We have to do something, Harry!"
RON	48	Works for me.
RON	50	Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth.
RON	53	Sss.
RON	61	Like hell!
RON	62	Expelliarmus! 
RON	94	Then you’re on our side.
RON	102	Who put it there? The fake.
HERMIONE	111	"Harry, are you thinking there’s a Horcrux in Bellatrix’s vault?"
RON	112	And if we find one? How’re we supposed to destroy it if we’ve given Griphook the sword?
RON	133	You’re sure it’s hers?
HERMIONE	134	Positive.
HERMIONE	136	Can’t I use the other?
RON	137	You heard Ollivander. It’s Harry’s now.
HERMIONE	138	But I hate that thing -- that’s
RON	140	"How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything."
RON	142	That’s a bit scary.
HERMIONE	143	"It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --"
HERMIONE	145	"It’s perfect. Thank you, Fleur."
RON	157	What d’you think?
RON	159	You want to tell me what that is?
RON	160	You mean he could see you?
RON	162	Go on.
RON	164	Bloody hell... that’s a sight.
RON	165	Hideous.
RON	166	"Couldn’t do anything about that bit in the back that’s always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --"
RON	167	Never mind. I’m good.
RON	170	Hey. Easy.
HERMIONE	172	He’s right. I was being stupid.
RON	177	What do you mean?
RON	178	"Harry, what do we do? Harry...?"
RON	189	What’s that? Up ahead. 
RON	194	You don’t say.
RON	199	Imperio!
RON	201	No. It’s not possible...
RON	202	Bloody hell. That’s a Welsh Green.
HERMIONE	203	It looks like it’s been down here forever.
RON	205	It’s been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise. 
HERMIONE	206	That’s barbaric. I...
RON	210	Blimey...
HERMIONE	211	Look. Hermione crosses to what appears to be the Sword of Gryffindor.
HERMIONE	212	No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
RON	213	"Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?"
HERMIONE	214	It’s hot! 
HERMIONE	215	"Ron, your foot!"
HERMIONE	218	How’re we going to reach it?
RON	220	Keep going!
HERMIONE	221	Harry! Behind you!
HERMIONE	222	In here!
RON	227	Foul little git. Least we’ve got Bogrod.
RON	228	That’s unfortunate.
HERMIONE	229	We can’t just stand here! Who’s got an idea?
RON	230	You’re asking us? You’re the brilliant one.
HERMIONE	231	I’ve got something. But it’s mad.
HERMIONE	232	Relashio!
RON	233	That’s your idea?
HERMIONE	235	It doesn’t realize it’s free!
RON	236	That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!
RON	237	Bloody hell.
RON	239	I say we jump!
HERMIONE	240	When?
HERMIONE	242	How is it you --
HERMIONE	244	"You let him in! Harry, you can’t --"
RON	246	Never mind! What did you see?
HERMIONE	248	You saw it?
HERMIONE	250	Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --
RON	253	Maybe it’s because of the
HERMIONE	254	They were ready for us. 
HERMIONE	255	"No, you’ll give us away."
RON	258	Did you get a look at him! For a second I thought it was --
HERMIONE	259	Harry! I can see you! In here!
HERMIONE	269	Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
HERMIONE	272	Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.
HERMIONE	273	"Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn’t seem like someone who’s given up, does it?"
RON	279	I don’t remember this being on the Marauder’s Map.
HERMIONE	281	"How bad is it, Neville? With"
HERMIONE	282	They did that to you? But why?
RON	300	Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what’s a bloody diadem?
RON	306	"Shut up, Seamus."
SNAPE	309	Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at
SNAPE	310	I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by rumor.
SNAPE	311	Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter’s movements this evening... I invite
RON	332	"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn’t really matter if we find the Horcrux."
HERMIONE	333	Unless we can destroy it.
RON	334	So we were thinking --
HERMIONE	335	You were thinking. It’s Ron’s idea. And it’s brilliant.
RON	336	"You destroyed Tom Riddle’s Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don’t we?"
HERMIONE	338	Where are you going?
VOLDEMORT	347	Begin.
HERMIONE	370	No. Of course not.
RON	371	I’ve never got this far before.
HERMIONE	372	I’m scared.
RON	373	Me too.
HERMIONE	374	I didn’t expect it to be like this.
RON	375	What did you expect it to be like?
HERMIONE	376	Not this.
RON	399	You do it.
RON	400	"Yes, you can."
RON	414	Bloody hell. We’ll never find him on this.
RON	415	What? 
RON	416	Brilliant.
HERMIONE	417	He vanished. Just now. I saw it.
RON	418	Let’s go.
HERMIONE	419	Brilliant. 
HERMIONE	436	Did you see where it went? The diadem!
RON	439	RUN! Goyle’s set the bloody place on fire! 
HERMIONE	441	Do we climb!
HERMIONE	444	C’mon! This way!
RON	446	"IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!"
RON	447	Brilliant.
VOLDEMORT	448	Nagini. Come. 
RON	449	You’re bloody well welcome!
HERMIONE	451	Someplace safe.
RON	452	"Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we’re one step closer to ending this."
VOLDEMORT	454	I do not need to seek the boy!
VOLDEMORT	456	"How do you live with yourself, Lucius?"
HERMIONE	461	NO! 
VOLDEMORT	462	Why doesn’t it work for me?
SNAPE	463	"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In"
VOLDEMORT	464	No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!
SNAPE	465	There is no wand more powerful.
VOLDEMORT	466	Does it?
SNAPE	467	My Lord?
VOLDEMORT	468	"You’re a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know."
VOLDEMORT	469	"Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?"
SNAPE	470	"With you, of course, my Lord."
SNAPE	471	My Lord --
VOLDEMORT	472	"You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus. "
VOLDEMORT	473	But only I can live forever...
VOLDEMORT	474	Kill.
VOLDEMORT	475	Nagini! Come!
SNAPE	476	Please. 
SNAPE	478	You have your mother’s eyes... 
RON	479	Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!
HERMIONE	480	Where is everyone?
SNAPE	486	No! Don’t kill me!
SNAPE	490	Yes.
SNAPE	492	Only what I heard. But now... he
SNAPE	494	I have asked.
SNAPE	497	Anything.
SNAPE	498	You said you would keep her safe!
SNAPE	499	DON’T!
SNAPE	501	No one can know. Your word.
SNAPE	504	You see what you want to see. 
SNAPE	506	Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.
SNAPE	508	Drink the rest. It will contain
SNAPE	510	It will spread.
SNAPE	512	Maybe a year.
SNAPE	517	You ask too much.
SNAPE	521	"So when the time comes, the boy must die."
SNAPE	523	You’ve kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You’ve been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
SNAPE	525	Expecto Patronum!
SNAPE	527	Always... 
HERMIONE	528	Where’ve you been?
RON	529	"We thought you’d gone to the forest, we thought you might be --"
RON	531	Are you mad! No!
RON	533	Rubbish! You can’t just give
HERMIONE	534	"What is it, Harry? What is it you know?"
HERMIONE	537	I’ll go with you. I’ll --
VOLDEMORT	557	"I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken."
VOLDEMORT	615	I do not require assistance.
VOLDEMORT	620	"Behold, Nagini. Our work is done."
VOLDEMORT	622	SILENCE!
VOLDEMORT	623	Stupid girl. You cry for that? 
VOLDEMORT	624	"While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to"
RON	625	Liar!
VOLDEMORT	626	"Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer"
VOLDEMORT	627	Now is the time to declare yourself. 
VOLDEMORT	631	"Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don’t be shy."
VOLDEMORT	632	"Well, I must say, I’d hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?"
VOLDEMORT	633	"Who might you be, young man?"
VOLDEMORT	635	"Well, welcome, Neville. I’m sure we can find a place for you in our ranks."
VOLDEMORT	637	"Now, now, Bellatrix. Let’s not underestimate our young friend."
VOLDEMORT	639	"Very well, Neville. I’m sure we’d all be fascinated to hear what you have to say."
RON	643	"Well done, Malfoy!"
VOLDEMORT	646	Nagini! With me!
VOLDEMORT	647	I said LEAVE HER!
VOLDEMORT	648	Nagini!
VOLDEMORT	649	Die! Die!
VOLDEMORT	650	Why do you live! 
RON	657	Hermione!
HERMIONE	658	Yes!
RON	659	I need to tell you something!
HERMIONE	660	I don’t want you to say anything you wouldn’t say if we weren’t about to be killed by a giant snake! It’ll just ruin it!
VOLDEMORT	663	It belongs to me! I killed Snape!
RON	668	"Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?"
HERMIONE	669	Can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
HERMIONE	670	Something my mum used to say.
RON	673	But that means...
RON	675	What do you reckon we should do with it?
HERMIONE	676	We?
RON	677	"I’m just saying. That’s the Elder Wand! It’s the most powerful bloody wand in the world! With that, we could, we could --"
