HERMIONE	51	HARRY--!
HERMIONE	52	Are you all right? We overheard
HERMIONE	53	--and this hearing at the Ministry--it's just outrageous!
RON	55	It's Headquarters...
HERMIONE	56	...of the Order of the Phoenix. It's a secret society; Dumbledore
RON	58	"We wanted to write mate, really we did--only--"
HERMIONE	60	Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything.
RON	144	"It's only Malfoy, Harry. What'd you expect...?"
RON	148	What's what?
HERMIONE	150	"Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself--like always."
HERMIONE	154	What an interesting necklace.
HERMIONE	159	You know her?
RON	167	Illuminating? What a load of waffle!
HERMIONE	168	There was important stuff hidden in that waffle.
HERMIONE	170	It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.
RON	181	"As a matter of fact, I do! So unless you want a fistful of Weasley you'll shut your mouth!"
RON	182	You all right?
RON	184	"Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then."
HERMIONE	188	There's nothing in here about actually using defensive spells.
HERMIONE	189	But surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts--
SNAPE	219	Yes.
SNAPE	221	Obviously.
SNAPE	223	I suggest you ask him.
RON	241	"...I'm not asking you to write all of it for me, just...most of it."
HERMIONE	242	All right; I'll do the introduction--but that's all. 
HERMIONE	243	I'll know you're back to normal.
HERMIONE	244	What's wrong with your hand?
HERMIONE	245	You've got to tell Dumbledore.
RON	246	"Bloody hell Harry, the woman's torturing you! If the parents knew about this--!"
HERMIONE	248	Harry...You've got to report this. It's a simple matter of--
HERMIONE	252	Then help us to.
HERMIONE	263	Don't you ever stop eating?
RON	264	Wha'? Ah'm 'ungry...
RON	265	Harry.
HERMIONE	285	"That foul, evil old gargoyle! We've got to do something! "
HERMIONE	286	"THAT'S NOT THE POINT, RON! We're not learning how to defend ourselves, we're not learning what we need to pass our OWLS, she's taking over the entire school-- what's Dumbledore playing at?"
HERMIONE	296	We've got to be able to defend ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how...
RON	298	Look on the bright side--you can't be any worse than old toad-face. 
RON	299	"I'm here for you, mate."
RON	300	Lovely spot.
HERMIONE	301	I thought it'd be safer someplace off the beaten track.
HERMIONE	303	"Oh, just a couple of people..."
HERMIONE	304	"Um--hi. So, you all know why we're here. We need a teacher--a proper teacher, one who's had real experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts--"
RON	306	"Why? Because You-Know-Who is back, you tosspot!"
HERMIONE	307	So Dumbledore says--
HERMIONE	311	Yes. I've seen it. A fully-formed stag Patronus.
HERMIONE	318	You're right Harry. We don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're to have any chance of beating V-Voldemort...
RON	321	Not bloody likely.
RON	323	"Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger? "
HERMIONE	327	"You've done it, Neville! You've found the Room of Requirement!"
HERMIONE	328	I've heard rumors about it for ages but I never believed them until now...!
RON	329	"So, say you really needed a toilet...?"
HERMIONE	330	"Charming, Ronald. But yes, that's"
HERMIONE	340	No need to think's more like it.
RON	346	Don't worry--I'll go easy on you.
RON	347	"I--I let her do that. I mean it's just good manners, isn't it!"
RON	364	Well? How was it?
HERMIONE	366	I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half
RON	367	You'd think a bit of snogging
HERMIONE	368	"Well obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric, and therefore confused about liking Harry and"
RON	369	"One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode!"
HERMIONE	370	Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon...
SNAPE	377	"You wished to see me, Headmaster?"
SNAPE	379	It would appear there is a connection between the Dark Lord's
SNAPE	381	Read it. Control it. Unhinge it... In the past it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the
HERMIONE	394	Harry? Time to go.
HERMIONE	405	"Oh Hagrid, what happened?"
RON	407	Nothing? Would you say that if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?
HERMIONE	410	Giants!
RON	414	Death Eaters?
RON	442	...you did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
HERMIONE	443	"He's right. Not even Dumbledore saw this coming. Besides, if it's anyone's fault it's ours..."
RON	444	"Yeah, we talked you into it. "
HERMIONE	447	What?
RON	450	Any idea where he's taking us?
HERMIONE	452	What is that?
RON	453	Whatever it is...it's not a happy sound.
RON	457	Harry...that hill. It's breathing. 
HERMIONE	458	Oh Hagrid...you didn't.
HERMIONE	460	Small?
RON	462	Blimey.
RON	470	"HAGRID, DO SOMETHING!"
HERMIONE	472	Grawp. GRAWP. Listen. Carefully: Put. Me. DOWN.
RON	473	Are you all right?
HERMIONE	474	Just needs a firm hand is all.
RON	476	You just stay away from her. 
SNAPE	477	Feeling sentimental...? 
SNAPE	479	Not to me--and not to the Dark Lord if you don't improve! Every
SNAPE	481	Weak.
SNAPE	483	"Then prove it. Control your emotions, discipline your mind! Legilimens--!"
SNAPE	485	I may vomit.
SNAPE	487	Is this what you call control?
SNAPE	490	YOUR FATHER WAS A SWINE--
SNAPE	491	LEGILIMENS!
SNAPE	502	ENOUGH--!!!
SNAPE	503	Your lessons are at an end.
SNAPE	505	Get. Out.
VOLDEMORT	516	Oh I will. But first you will fetch it for me. CRUCIO!
HERMIONE	517	"Harry, are you sure?"
HERMIONE	519	"Harry, please, just listen. What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? What if he's only hurting"
RON	520	What do we do.
RON	522	Are you mental? We're going with you!
HERMIONE	524	"When are you going to get it through your head, Harry--we're in this together!"
SNAPE	529	I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students; the last of it on Miss Chang...
SNAPE	532	No idea.
HERMIONE	538	"Well if you won't tell her where it is, I will! It's not worth another student dying!"
HERMIONE	540	Dumbledore's secret weapon. 
HERMIONE	542	Not far. It had to be somewhere students weren't going to find it accidentally. 
HERMIONE	544	Improvising.
HERMIONE	552	STOP IT! STOP!
HERMIONE	563	"Thank you, Grawp."
HERMIONE	565	How did you get away?
RON	566	Told 'em I was hungry and wanted
RON	570	"Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate."
HERMIONE	575	But V-Voldemort...
HERMIONE	579	What if Voldemort learned about
HERMIONE	599	Ron--!
RON	600	STUPEFY--!!
RON	601	Better keep running.
HERMIONE	606	HURRY! 
RON	607	Department of Mysteries... Got
HERMIONE	608	"There aren't any voices, Harry. Let's get out of here--"
HERMIONE	610	"It's just an empty archway! Please Harry, they'll be here any--"
HERMIONE	628	Go.
VOLDEMORT	639	Don't speak to me. Or can you restore my broken Prophecy?
VOLDEMORT	640	You know the spell. Do it--
VOLDEMORT	641	"You're too late, old man. The boy knows the truth."
VOLDEMORT	642	That you've been lied too... betrayed...just as I once was.
VOLDEMORT	643	"NO. Because he ""loved"" you."
VOLDEMORT	644	"Why did your mother and father die? Why will your friends die, when"
VOLDEMORT	647	"Yes. By which time I shall be gone, and you dead--"
VOLDEMORT	649	suddenly inhales deeply--focuses intently--
VOLDEMORT	651	LOOK AT ME!
VOLDEMORT	659	"You are a fool, Harry Potter..."
VOLDEMORT	660	And you will lose everything.
RON	670	Feast's about to start.
RON	672	You know...I'm not really that hungry. I could...
HERMIONE	682	"What's that, Harry?"
RON	684	What's that?
