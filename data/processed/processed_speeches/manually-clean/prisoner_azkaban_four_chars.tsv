HERMIONE	74	That's rich coming from the owner
RON	76	Brilliant. It's got loads of old stuff. Mummies. Death masks. Tombs --
HERMIONE	77	"You know, the ancient Egyptians of"
RON	78	I also got a new wand. 
RON	80	I haven't shown anyone!
RON	101	Brilliant!
HERMIONE	102	"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny."
RON	103	I still think it was brilliant. 
HERMIONE	105	C'mon. We're in here.
RON	106	You know everything. How is it
HERMIONE	107	"Seems to be. Why? What is it, Harry?"
RON	109	Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
HERMIONE	111	"But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean... eventually?"
RON	112	"Sure -- Of course, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a raving, murderous lunatic... "
HERMIONE	113	Why're we stopping? We can't be there yet...
RON	114	What's going on?
HERMIONE	116	"Ouch! Ron, that was my foot! "
RON	117	There's something moving out there. I think... people are coming aboard.
RON	118	Bloody hell. What's happening? 
HERMIONE	120	"Harry? Harry, are you all right?"
HERMIONE	125	"It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black."
RON	128	"Well, you sort of went... rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something."
RON	129	No. I felt... weird. Like I'd never be cheerful again. But... no.
HERMIONE	130	I was trembling. Cold. But then... Professor Lupin made it go away...
HERMIONE	132	"No one was screaming, Harry."
RON	137	"Good to be home, eh, Harry?"
RON	140	Where'd you come from?
HERMIONE	141	Me? I've been here all along.
RON	149	Well. He's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering. But this lot here could be the sun -- that's great happiness. So... he's going to suffer but be very happy about it.
HERMIONE	157	"Death omens. Honestly. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline. Now Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject."
RON	158	Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?
HERMIONE	159	A fair few.
RON	160	Hang on. Ancient Runes is the same time as Divination. You'd have to be in two classes at once.
HERMIONE	161	Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
RON	170	Hagrid. Exactly what is that?
HERMIONE	184	"Hagrid. He's got to be taken to a hospital. I'll go with you, if you like --"
HERMIONE	188	Yes. But I hear Draco's father's furious. I don't think we've heard the end of this...
RON	190	Who? 
HERMIONE	191	Achintee? That's not far from here...
HERMIONE	198	No one knows.
HERMIONE	199	Boggarts are shape-shifters.
RON	215	Riddikulus! 
HERMIONE	238	"But, I mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring. Don't you think, Ron?"
RON	239	Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing. Hang on. I almost forgot. I got you something wicked at Dervish
RON	240	"If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up"
RON	242	"Oh, careful of those, they'll make your... "
RON	243	Never mind.
RON	244	What's the hold-up? Only Neville ever forgets the password.
SNAPE	250	"I've done the dungeons, Headmaster. No sign of Black. Nor anywhere else in the castle."
SNAPE	251	"Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own, completely undetected..."
SNAPE	252	"You may recall, prior to the start"
RON	260	"Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever need someone mental. "
SNAPE	261	Turn to page 394. 
SNAPE	263	"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say, your Professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time. Page 394."
RON	264	Werewolves?
HERMIONE	265	"But, sir, we've only just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks. We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks --"
SNAPE	266	Quiet!
SNAPE	267	Now. Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf? 
SNAPE	268	No one? How... disappointing.
HERMIONE	269	"Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and responds only to the call of its own kind -- "
SNAPE	270	"Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must admit to feeling your pain. That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell me. Are you incapable of restraining yourself? Or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?"
SNAPE	271	Five points from Gryffindor!
SNAPE	272	"Not exactly Picasso, are you? I hope you demonstrate more talent on the Quidditch pitch this weekend then you do as an artist."
HERMIONE	275	No!!!
HERMIONE	279	Harry! How're you feeling?
RON	283	You fell off your broom.
HERMIONE	285	"No one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't meant to come on"
RON	286	"There's something else you should know, Harry. Your Nimbus -- when it blew away? -- it sort of landed"
HERMIONE	318	It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
RON	319	Twice.
HERMIONE	320	Should we move a bit closer?
RON	321	Huh? Oh... All right...
RON	322	"Actually, it's fine from here."
HERMIONE	323	Perfect. 
RON	325	"Shut your mouth, Malfoy."
HERMIONE	330	Harry...? Harry?
RON	331	"Bloody hell, Harry! That was not funny!"
RON	332	Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map!
HERMIONE	333	But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to
HERMIONE	334	"Oh, shut up."
HERMIONE	335	That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron
RON	336	It's not true!
RON	341	Harry? He's gone. 
RON	379	Aaaahhhh!
RON	383	I don't know how he got in! I was
HERMIONE	384	That's a lie!
RON	385	It is not and you bloody well know it!
RON	388	I find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be in such denial.
HERMIONE	389	Harry. Will you explain to your
RON	391	"Really? Wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to ribbons! A person could die being your friend, Harry!"
HERMIONE	392	"How'd it go, Hagrid?"
HERMIONE	394	I meant the hearing.
HERMIONE	396	"You mustn't blame yourself, Hagrid."
SNAPE	401	Potter. What're you doing wandering the corridors at night?
SNAPE	403	"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. Strutting about the castle --"
SNAPE	405	Turn out your pockets.
SNAPE	406	Turn out your pockets! 
SNAPE	408	Really...
SNAPE	409	Read it.
SNAPE	411	Go on.
SNAPE	413	"Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?"
SNAPE	415	"That remains to be seen. I've just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. This is supposed to be your area of expertise."
SNAPE	416	"Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic."
HERMIONE	424	Here we go again. It's the Grim! It's the Grim!
RON	427	"She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental, but now it's out in the open for everyone to see... "
HERMIONE	432	I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible.
HERMIONE	436	You... foul... loathsome... evil... little cockroach... 
RON	437	Hermione! No!
RON	438	He's not worth it.
HERMIONE	439	That felt good.
HERMIONE	442	"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid."
RON	448	I'm not kissing Fang if that's what you're thinking...
RON	449	Scabbers! You're alive!
HERMIONE	451	I think you owe someone an apology.
RON	452	Right. Next time I see
HERMIONE	453	I meant me.
HERMIONE	460	"Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind."
HERMIONE	461	Ron! No! 
HERMIONE	462	Harry. You do realize what tree this is...
RON	463	Now behave yourself. 
RON	465	Harry! Run!
RON	466	Aaaahhh!
HERMIONE	467	I've got you -- 
RON	468	Harry!
HERMIONE	472	Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!
HERMIONE	473	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
HERMIONE	475	Thanks.
HERMIONE	477	Where do you suppose this goes?
HERMIONE	479	"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
HERMIONE	481	Ron! You're okay --
RON	482	"It's a trap, Harry. He's the dog. He's an Animagus..."
HERMIONE	483	"If you want to kill Harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too!"
HERMIONE	486	Harry! No! 
HERMIONE	491	No! I trusted you! I covered up for you. And all this time you've
HERMIONE	493	Since Professor Snape set the essay.
RON	510	You're mad...
SNAPE	511	Expelliarmus!
SNAPE	513	I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle.
SNAPE	515	Give me a reason. I beg you.
SNAPE	519	"Witty as ever I see. Tell me, will you be so irreverent when I turn you over to the Dementors?"
SNAPE	520	After you. 
HERMIONE	522	Harry. You attacked a teacher.
RON	525	M-me? It's lunatic...
RON	527	Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my family for --
RON	528	So what?
RON	531	What are you going to do to him?
HERMIONE	547	Don't worry. He's under the Somnambulist Charm. It's primarily used to transport the seriously deranged.
HERMIONE	556	Harry...
HERMIONE	561	Professor...?
SNAPE	562	Out of the way! ... and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce. Leaping
HERMIONE	564	Harry!
HERMIONE	572	What...?
HERMIONE	574	"Listen, Harry. They've captured Sirius. Any minute the Dementors are going to perform the Kiss."
HERMIONE	575	It's what Dementors do to those
HERMIONE	577	No. It's worse. Much worse. You go on living. But you have no memory. No sense of self. You're just a shall. An empty shell... 
HERMIONE	578	Headmaster! You've got to stop
RON	580	It's Scabbers who did it!
RON	582	"My rat, sir. Only he's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. You see, he used to be my brother Percy's --"
RON	587	What in bloody hell was all that about? 
HERMIONE	588	"Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you can't walk... "
HERMIONE	591	Seven-thirty. Where were we at seven-thirty?
HERMIONE	593	Come on! We can't be seen! 
HERMIONE	596	"This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year."
HERMIONE	598	Yes. Dumbledore wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly something happened he wants us to change.
HERMIONE	599	Hurry! Malfoy's coming! 
HERMIONE	602	We'll see.
HERMIONE	603	What?
HERMIONE	606	"No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise,"
HERMIONE	608	"No, Harry! You can't!"
HERMIONE	610	Yes! You Must!
HERMIONE	611	Fudge is coming and... we're not leaving... why aren't we leaving?
HERMIONE	614	Sorry. 
HERMIONE	615	C'mon. Any minute now we're going to be coming out the back door. 
HERMIONE	616	Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
HERMIONE	618	"Now, Harry! "
HERMIONE	621	"Here, Beaky... Come and get the nice dead ferret... yum yum..."
HERMIONE	631	We save Sirius.
HERMIONE	632	No idea.
HERMIONE	633	Look. It's Lupin.
HERMIONE	635	Here comes Snape. 
HERMIONE	636	Now we wait.
HERMIONE	637	'Least someone's enjoying himself.
HERMIONE	639	Yes?
HERMIONE	641	With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore when we were taken to the hospital. According
HERMIONE	644	"But, Harry, your Dad's..."
HERMIONE	646	Here we come.
HERMIONE	648	Really?
HERMIONE	650	It's happened. Lupin's transformed.
HERMIONE	653	Saving your life.
HERMIONE	655	Why?
HERMIONE	657	Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night... 
HERMIONE	660	This is horrible...
HERMIONE	662	"No one's coming, Harry..."
HERMIONE	663	"No one's coming! You're dying, both of you... and no one's coming!"
HERMIONE	664	"HARRY, NO!"
HERMIONE	667	No.
HERMIONE	668	Out of the way!
HERMIONE	669	Didn't really expect that to work.
HERMIONE	670	Dunamis! Liberare! Annihilare! Emancipare! No. No. No. No.
HERMIONE	672	Quiet! I'm trying to think.
HERMIONE	673	BOMBARDA! 
HERMIONE	683	We have to go.
RON	688	How'd you two get over there? I was just talking to you... over there.
HERMIONE	689	"What d'you think, Harry? Too much"
RON	708	"Stand back, I said! I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle!"
RON	711	Quiet!
HERMIONE	714	It's a mystery. Though... this fell out of the wrapping.
