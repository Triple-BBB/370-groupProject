RON	61	Hiya, Harry.
RON	63	Rescuing you, of course. Where's your trunk? 13B CLOSEUP - HARRY'S TRUNK 13B Stuffed with clothes, spellbooks. The trunk CLOSES, SNAPS SHUT. Harry drags the trunk to the windowsill, watches Ron tie off a fierce knot on the bars of Harry's window.
RON	64	Stand back.
RON	67	Hold on, Harry!
RON	69	Put your foot down, Fred!
RON	70	By the way, Harry. Happy Birthday. DISSOLVE TO:
RON	72	It's not much.
RON	75	They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window!
RON	78	Ginny. Been talking about you all summer. Dead annoying, really.
RON	81	Dad works at the Ministry of Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.
RON	82	That's when wizards bewitch something to drive Muggles mad. Shrinking door keys, that kind of thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks they're fascinating.
RON	84	Harry, sir. Harry Potter.
RON	91	Harry's never traveled by Floo Powder before, Mum.
HERMIONE	116	Hello, Hagrid. Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again.
HERMIONE	117	Oculus Reparo. Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.
HERMIONE	119	C'mon. Everyone's been so worried.
HERMIONE	122	Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy Lockhart's going to be there! We can actually meet him! I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist! As Mrs. Weasley and Hermione dash off, Harry frowns.
HERMIONE	133	Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
RON	145	We better hurry.
RON	148	I dunno. The gateway's sealed itself for some reason.
RON	149	Can't hear a thing.
RON	152	Who says we're driving?
RON	154	Look, who knows when Mum and Dad will get back. And we've got to get to school, haven't we? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's an absolute emergency. Least that's what Fred
RON	157	No problem. Ron SHIFTS. With a GREAT JOLT, the car lifts from the ground.
RON	158	There. See. Now I reckon all we have to do is find the Hogwarts Express and follow it. Simple.
RON	160	Right. Ron presses a TINY SILVER BUTTON on the dashboard and
RON	161	Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster must be faulty. CAMERA ZOOMS ALONG the ridge of a cliff. The car reappears from above, gliding away FROM CAMERA.
RON	162	Any sign of the train?
RON	164	Brilliant. Ron SHIFTS, GLIDES DOWN, until the Anglia is only a few feet above the tracks. The boys peer ahead, looking for
RON	165	It must be around here someplace.
RON	167	Take my hand! Harry's grips Ron's hand, eyes the train steaming far below. It's quite a drop. Harry's fingers begin to LOSE
RON	168	Hold on!
RON	171	Welcome home, Harry.
RON	173	Well... no. but, until a few hours ago, I'd never taken off in one either. With that, the car LURCHES, the nose DROPS, and...
RON	174	Uh oh.
RON	175	IT'S NOT WORKING!
RON	179	STOP! STOP! STOP!
RON	180	My wand! Look at my wand!
RON	182	What's happening?
RON	183	What kind of tree is this? Before Harry can respond, the tree begins to PUMMEL THE CAR from all sides, tossing Henry and Ron about like popcorn. WINDOWS SHATTER. Heavy DENTS appear on the roof above Ron and Harry's heads. Then the car FALLS again... ... SLAMMING HEAVILY TO THE GROUND. Instantly, the tree's lower branches shoot through the front and rear windscreens and, gaining purchase, begin to SHAKE THE CAR
RON	186	Dad's going to kill me.
SNAPE	190	You were seen! By no less then seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that has been on these grounds for hundreds of years.
RON	191	Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
SNAPE	192	Silence! I assure you, were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight. As it is --
SNAPE	193	Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...
RON	195	Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you?
HERMIONE	199	I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got.
RON	200	I should think you'd mind your own business.
HERMIONE	202	Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been
RON	209	Say it. I'm doomed.
RON	214	Imagine that.
RON	217	Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh... no.
RON	223	Look at these questions. They're
RON	225	'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?'
RON	235	What do we do now?
RON	237	Can you believe him?
HERMIONE	238	I'm sure Professor Lockhart just wanted to give us some hands-on experience.
RON	240	Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
RON	246	Those are Nimbus Two Thousand Ones.
HERMIONE	249	At least no one on the Gryffindor
RON	252	You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!
HERMIONE	253	Ron! Say something!
HERMIONE	257	It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone... like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
HERMIONE	273	Harry!
RON	275	Hear what?
HERMIONE	277	Voice? What voice?
RON	280	Harry, what are you doing?
HERMIONE	281	'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened...?'
RON	282	What's that? Hanging underneath?
HERMIONE	284	Look at that. Have you ever seen spiders act like that? Ron...?
SNAPE	294	If I might, Headmaster...
SNAPE	295	However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
HERMIONE	297	That's why Ron and I went looking
RON	302	A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got
HERMIONE	303	Harry. This voice. You said you heard it first in Lockhart's office?
HERMIONE	305	I hardly think someone with
HERMIONE	307	'Course we do. It's just... it's a bit weird, isn't it? You hear this voice and then... Mrs. Norris
RON	309	Are you mad!
HERMIONE	310	No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. 61 OMITTED 61
HERMIONE	311	Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets? A HUSH falls over the class.
HERMIONE	312	Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about
RON	313	Three glasses who?
HERMIONE	314	Muggle-borns.
HERMIONE	315	Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
RON	316	D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
HERMIONE	317	Yes. Couldn't you tell: McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
RON	319	Of course! You heard him: 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!
HERMIONE	320	I heard him. But Malfoy? The Heir of Slytherin?
RON	322	Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling...
RON	323	When do we start?
HERMIONE	324	Here it is: 'The Polyjuice Potion. Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another...'
RON	325	You mean, Harry and I drink some of this stuff and we turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
HERMIONE	326	Yes.
RON	327	Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!
HERMIONE	328	Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed. And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too.
RON	329	Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it.
HERMIONE	331	A month.
HERMIONE	333	You didn't have to tell me that.
RON	337	Rogue Bludger?
HERMIONE	339	You're joking, right? Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry. As Harry frantically dips and dives, Malfoy cruises by.
HERMIONE	341	Finite Incantatem!
HERMIONE	346	You will be able to, won't you?
HERMIONE	370	Again? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
RON	371	Of course! Don't you see? Lucius
HERMIONE	372	Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
RON	373	Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?
HERMIONE	374	Never. No one over comes in here.
RON	375	Why?
RON	376	Who's Moaning Myrtle? There is a LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF A
HERMIONE	378	She's a little sensitive. 64.
RON	382	What's the fun in that?
SNAPE	385	Expelliarmus! A dazzling flash of SCARLET LIGHT bursts forth and BLASTS
HERMIONE	386	Do you think he's all right? HARRY/RON Who cares?
SNAPE	387	Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.
SNAPE	389	Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house. Malfoy, perhaps.
SNAPE	396	Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.
RON	398	You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't you tell us?
HERMIONE	400	You can talk to snakes.
RON	403	Oh, that's what you said to it.
RON	405	I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language.
HERMIONE	407	I don't know, Harry. But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. It was... creepy.
HERMIONE	408	Harry, listen out me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar
RON	409	Exactly. And now the whole
RON	438	Oh, c'mon, Harry. Fred's just having a laugh.
RON	440	Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night. Who cares?
HERMIONE	442	You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't. And if it makes you feel better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too.
RON	443	Why would that make anyone feel better?
HERMIONE	444	Because, in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion's will be ready. In a few days... we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin.
HERMIONE	445	Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
RON	447	How?
HERMIONE	448	I've got it all worked out. I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful.
HERMIONE	449	You know how greedy Crabbe and
HERMIONE	450	I've already got mine.
HERMIONE	451	Millicent Bulstrode. She's in Slytherin. I got this off her robes.
HERMIONE	452	Remember. Just make sure Crabbe
RON	453	Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?
HERMIONE	454	Did you get it?
HERMIONE	455	I sneaked those out of the laundry.
HERMIONE	456	I'm sure I've done everything right. It looks like the book said it should. Once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
RON	457	Now what?
HERMIONE	458	We separate it into three glasses
RON	459	Ugh. Essence of Crabbe...
RON	460	Think I'm gonna be sick...
RON	461	Harry?
RON	463	Bloody hell.
RON	468	Hey... Where's Hermione?
RON	470	Don't swing your arms like that.
RON	471	Yeah. That's better. 84 GLOOMY CORRIDOR/DUNGEONS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 84
RON	472	What are you doing here?
RON	473	What are you doing here?
RON	490	Ho!
RON	492	That was close!
HERMIONE	494	Go away!
HERMIONE	496	It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look at my face!
RON	497	Look at your tail.
HERMIONE	498	Oh, good. Put those anywhere.
HERMIONE	499	I've got to keep up, haven't I? Just then, Hermione's tail twitches INTO VIEW.
RON	500	Is that thing ever going away?
HERMIONE	501	Any day now, according to Madam Pomfrey. I'm just thankful I've stopped coughing up fur balls.
RON	502	We all are, believe me.
HERMIONE	503	Now. What about the Chamber of Secrets? Any new leads?
RON	505	'To Miss Granger. Wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.' You sleep with this under your pillow?
HERMIONE	506	Of course not. I don't know how that got there. Now go. I still have six hundred pages to read in Transformation Through the Ages. 91 OMITTED 91
RON	507	I know Hermione's mental, but can you believe she falls for that smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?
RON	509	Yuck.
RON	513	But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?
RON	517	Fifty points if you can get it
RON	520	It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry.
RON	521	Are you mad? That could be cursed. Dad once told me about a book the Ministry confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it.
RON	524	Who doesn't? Ron frowns suddenly. On the first page on the diary, EMBOSSED LETTERS spell out a name: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE.
RON	525	Tin Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I know that name...
HERMIONE	527	Fifty years ago? You're sure?
HERMIONE	529	Don't you remember what Malfoy told you? The last time the
HERMIONE	532	It might be invisible ink.
HERMIONE	533	I don't know, Harry. But I think you should be careful with this. Something tells me Ron might be right. It could be dangerous.
HERMIONE	535	I'm scared, Harry. But not of you.
RON	553	What? What's happened...?
HERMIONE	555	It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
RON	556	We don't even know this Riddle.
HERMIONE	557	Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go ask him about it?
RON	558	That'd be a cheerful visit. Hullo, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?
HERMIONE	563	It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless, it wasn't a student...
RON	564	Well, whoever it was, they were looking for something.
RON	565	Hey, Ginny! Going to the match?
RON	566	I tell you, she gets weirder and weirder by the day...
RON	567	No... don't tell me...
HERMIONE	568	Harry... I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library! As Hermione sprints back up the stairs, Harry YELLS.
RON	570	That's Hermione. When in doubt, go to the library
RON	574	Hermione!
RON	578	But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class --
RON	605	Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.
RON	608	What are you doing?
RON	610	They're heading into the Dark Forest.
RON	611	Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'? 120 OMITTED 120
RON	613	Harry!... Harry, it's our car! Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford Anglia looks half-animal. Ron circles it in wonder.
RON	616	I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --
RON	622	Harry...
RON	629	Can we panic now? CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! Harry and Ron SPIN. A GANG of FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead. Begin to move forward. Harry and Ron SPIN again: SPIDERS. Everywhere. CLOSING IN.
RON	630	Nice knowing you.
RON	632	Thanks for that.
RON	636	'Follow the spiders'! Follow the
RON	639	We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit. She's our... friend, you
RON	641	You don't think Lockhart could be
RON	644	But it kills by looking people in
RON	646	But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake. Someone would have seen...
SNAPE	648	Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.
SNAPE	650	Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where
RON	654	Harry. D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know --
RON	658	What about my sister?
RON	660	You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
RON	668	Is there anything you can do?
RON	679	Say something, Harry. Say something in Parseltongue.
RON	681	English.
RON	685	A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.
RON	691	What's that? Up ahead?
RON	694	Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long. Or more.
RON	695	Heart of a lion, this one.
RON	697	I'm okay. This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand. Lockhart sits up, dazed. Ron picks up a rock and CONKS
RON	698	What now?
RON	700	I'll try and shift some of this rock. So you can get back through. And, Harry --
RON	748	Ginny! Ron wriggles through, rushes forward and hugs Ginny.
RON	749	You're alive. I can't believe it.
RON	753	No.
RON	754	What's with the bird?
HERMIONE	795	You solved it! You solved it!
RON	797	Welcome back, Hermione.
HERMIONE	800	Oh, no! At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN. It's
