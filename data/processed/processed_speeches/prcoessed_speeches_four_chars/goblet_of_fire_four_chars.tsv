VOLDEMORT	5	NO! The boy is everything, it cannot
VOLDEMORT	7	Good. First, gather our old comrades.
VOLDEMORT	8	Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.
VOLDEMORT	9	Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.  A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic.
HERMIONE	10	Harry!
HERMIONE	11	Are you alright?
HERMIONE	13	Just now. You?
HERMIONE	15	Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
RON	16	Bloody hell.
HERMIONE	17	Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.
RON	20	Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?
HERMIONE	39	What??
RON	52	Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?
RON	63	There's no one like Krum. He's like
RON	69	Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.
RON	87	Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
RON	88	On second thought, just the drewbals.
RON	90	Just the drewbals, thanks.
HERMIONE	95	This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?
RON	96	Loads according to Dad, that's what
HERMIONE	97	It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.
HERMIONE	99	You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.
RON	116	Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.
HERMIONE	124	Three sir.  MAD-EYE
RON	126	Yes...  MAD-EYE Give us a curse.
RON	127	Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse.  MAD-EYE Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.  Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it.  MAD-EYE Hello. What a little beauty.
HERMIONE	129	Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering
HERMIONE	130	There's a reason those curses are unforgivable,
HERMIONE	131	Neville?
RON	132	Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be
HERMIONE	136	It's not going to work.
HERMIONE	138	You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
HERMIONE	140	So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
HERMIONE	151	Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
RON	168	How did you do it?
RON	169	Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
RON	171	You know bloody well what.
RON	173	Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend.
RON	175	Piss off.
RON	210	Who you talking to?
RON	212	I heard voices.
RON	214	You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.  Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone. The newspaper in the fire has the headline "TEENAGE TRAGEDY".
HERMIONE	220	Ronald would like me to tell you that
HERMIONE	222	Uhhh...
HERMIONE	223	Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
HERMIONE	225	I'm NOT an owl!
RON	252	You think so?
RON	254	Anything else?
RON	256	Fine.
HERMIONE	268	Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
HERMIONE	270	How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
HERMIONE	276	Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
HERMIONE	287	Your wand harry! Your wand!
RON	298	I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
RON	300	Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.
RON	302	At least I warned you about the dragons.
RON	303	Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that
RON	305	Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.
HERMIONE	306	Boys.
RON	308	Thank you Nigel.
RON	309	Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
RON	310	I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
RON	313	What are you on about?
HERMIONE	314	They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.
RON	315	Dress robes? for what?
RON	320	Where?
RON	327	Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?
RON	332	This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
RON	333	Well, us and Neville!
HERMIONE	334	It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
RON	335	Now I'm really depressed.
RON	336	Well Hermione, you're a girl.
HERMIONE	337	Oh well spotted.
RON	338	Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
HERMIONE	339	I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
RON	340	Bloody hell.
RON	341	Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
HERMIONE	354	What?
HERMIONE	355	No of course.
RON	357	There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.
RON	359	What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.  The Patil twins walk past.
RON	363	Bloody hell.
RON	364	What are those??
RON	366	Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar.
RON	368	Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
RON	369	I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
RON	373	Because nobody asked her. I would have
RON	381	No. Absolutely not.  Loud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with
HERMIONE	385	Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
RON	386	No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.
HERMIONE	387	What's got your wand in a knot?
RON	388	He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
RON	389	Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than
RON	391	No.
HERMIONE	393	How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
RON	394	Doubt it. He's way too old.
HERMIONE	395	What? What? That's what you think?
RON	396	Yeah that is what I think.
HERMIONE	397	You know the solution then don't you.
RON	398	Go on.
HERMIONE	399	Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.
RON	400	Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
HERMIONE	401	Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
VOLDEMORT	404	Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!
HERMIONE	407	I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean
HERMIONE	409	I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
HERMIONE	428	Harry, tell me again.
HERMIONE	430	The black lake, that's obvious.
HERMIONE	432	Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic
HERMIONE	434	Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.  Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway.  MAD-EYE Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger.
HERMIONE	435	But sir, the second task is only hours away and...  MAD-EYE Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!
RON	465	Well... yeah... a bit
RON	466	Merci.
HERMIONE	467	Harry!
HERMIONE	469	Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.   Hermione kisses Harry on the head.
HERMIONE	471	Next to last.
RON	475	Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
RON	480	We're still misfits.
VOLDEMORT	556	Kill the spare.
VOLDEMORT	558	Do it, now!
VOLDEMORT	563	My wand Wormtail.
VOLDEMORT	564	Hold out your arm.
VOLDEMORT	566	The other arm Wormtail.
VOLDEMORT	567	Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me.  Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures.
VOLDEMORT	568	Not even you, Lucius.
VOLDEMORT	570	There were signs my friend, and more than whispers.
VOLDEMORT	573	Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.  Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.
VOLDEMORT	575	Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The
VOLDEMORT	576	Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!  Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic.
VOLDEMORT	577	That's better. And now...
VOLDEMORT	578	Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up.
VOLDEMORT	579	Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes.
VOLDEMORT	581	No!
HERMIONE	615	Bye.
RON	617	Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
HERMIONE	618	No.
HERMIONE	620	Everything's going to change now isn't it?
HERMIONE	622	Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
RON	623	Well I won't. You know I won't!
