DUMBLEDORE	1	I should have known you'd be here,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	2	Are the rumors true, Albus?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	3	And the boy?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	4	You think it...wise...to trust
DUMBLEDORE	5	I would trust Hagrid with my life, Professor. A LOW RUMBLE disturbs the skies. Dumbledore and McGonagall look up and—suddenly—a HUGE MOTORCYCLE plummets through the clouds, hits the ground with a THUNDEROUS ROAR. As the SMOKE
HAGRID	6	Ev'ning, professor Dumbledore, sir.
DUMBLEDORE	7	No problems, I take it, Hagrid?
HAGRID	8	No sir. Little tyke fell ter sleep as we was flyin' o'er Bristol. Hagrid steps forward and Dumbledore takes the bundle, turns toward the doorstep.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	9	Albus, do you really think it best
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	10	But this boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who
DUMBLEDORE	11	Exactly. It would be enough to turn
DUMBLEDORE	12	There, there, Hagrid. It's not eally goodbye, after all.
DUMBLEDORE	13	Good luck, Harry Potter. The CAMERA DOLLIES forward, toward the swaddled baby. A CUT, still fresh, gleams on the baby's forehead. It is in the shape of a BOLT of LIGHTNING. SMASH CUT TO TEN YEARS LATER. 3.
AUNT PETUNIA	14	There's the birthday boy! Don't you look smart for your trip to the zoo.
HARRY	15	Yes, Aunt Petunia.
UNCLE VERNON	16	Bring my coffee, boy.
HARRY	17	Yes, Uncle Vernon.
DUDLEY	18	How many are there?
DUDLEY	19	Thirty-six. But last year...last year I had thirty-seven...
UNCLE VERNON	20	Well now, son, some of these are quite a bit bigger than last year--
DUDLEY	21	I DON'T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE!
AUNT PETUNIA	22	Now, now, here's what we'll do. Today, when we're out, we'll buy you two more presents. How's that, popkin?
DUDLEY	23	So then I'll have...I'll have...
HARRY	24	Thirty-eight, popkin.
AUNT PETUNIA	25	You just mind that bacon!
HARRY	26	Yes, Aunt Petunia. As Dudley tears open a BOX of LEAD SOLDIERS, Uncle Vernon
UNCLE VERNON	27	Want your money's worth, don't you, tiger. Well, look there. Aunt Marge's sent you the Fourth Battalion?
DUDLEY	28	This one's lost its head.
UNCLE VERNON	29	5. Well now, son. Remember, we talked about this. They're not meant to move... As Dudleyrtosses the damaged soldier aside, Harry studies it closely, then...Aunt Petunia HANGS UP the phone, turns.
UNCLE VERNON	30	We could phone Yvonne.
HARRY	31	You could just leave me here.
UNCLE VERNON	32	And come back to find the house in ruins?
DUDLEY	33	I...Don't...Want...Him...To...Come!
DUDLEY	34	Three?
AUNT PETUNIA	35	As many as you want, sweetums.
UNCLE VERNON	36	I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you'll have no meals for a week... 6.
DUDLEY	37	Make it move.
HARRY	38	He's asleep.
DUDLEY	39	He's boring. Dudley waddles away and the others follow, all but Harry, who steps forward and rubs Dudley's noseprint from the glass.
HARRY	40	Can you hear me? The snake cocks its head and...winks.
HARRY	41	It's just, I've never talked to a snake before. Do you, I mean...do you talk to people often? The snake regards Harry...then slowly shakes its head no. Harry nods, looking a bit unnerved.
HARRY	42	So...you're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Do you miss your family?
DUDLEY	43	MUMMY! DAD! COME HERE! You won't believe what this snake is doing!
HARRY	44	I swear, I don't know how it happened! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone. It was like magic.
UNCLE VERNON	45	There's...no...such...thing...as... magic!
UNCLE VERNON	46	8. Proudest moment of my life.
AUNT PETUNIA	47	You! Go to Smeltings? Don't be stupid. You'll goto state school, where you belong. That there'll be yours, once I'm done dying it.
HARRY	48	But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.
AUNT PETUNIA	49	Fit you fine enough. Now fetch the post.
UNCLE VERNON	50	Marge's ill. Ate a funny whelk... BAM! Dudley brings the Smelting stick down-hard on the table. 9.
DUDLEY	51	Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter! Quickly, Uncle Vernon SNATCHES it away.
HARRY	52	That's mine!
UNCLE VERNON	53	Yours. Who'd be writing to you—
HARRY	54	I want my letter!
DUDLEY	55	I want my stick!
AUNT PETUNIA	56	Vernon. Look at the address. How
UNCLE VERNON	57	Watching. Spying. Following us. We both know the dangerous nonsense your sister and her husband were mixed up in.
AUNT PETUNIA	58	But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back. Tell them we don't want—
HARRY	59	NO! I WANT MY LETTER!
UNCLE VERNON	60	Fine day, Sunday. Best day of the week in my opinion. Know why I say that, Dudley?
UNCLE VERNON	61	Right you are, Harry! No damn letters today! No sir. Not one blasted... Just then, something WHIZZES DOWN the chimney and SMACKS
DUDLEY	62	Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly! 12. A letter flutters on Harry's fingertips...before Uncle Vernon sweeps it away, eyes crazed, SHOUTING CRAZILY:
UNCLE VERNON	63	That does it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us! Where they can't get to us!
HARRY	64	Make a wish, Harry.
UNCLE VERNON	65	Who's there? I warn you--I'm armed! SMASH! The door falls flat. An IMMENSE SILHOUETTE stands against the raging sea outside, identical to the beastly
HAGRID	66	Er, right. Sorry 'bout that... Hagrid steps clear, takes the door, and fits it back into its frame. Glances at Dudley. Frowns.
HAGRID	67	Mind, I haven't seen yeh since you was a baby, Harry, but yeh're a bit more along than I woulda expected. ’Specially round the middle.
HARRY	68	I am.
HAGRID	69	Well now, course yeh are.
UNCLE VERNON	70	I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!
HAGRID	71	Ah, dry up, Dursley, yeh great prune. Hagrid takes the rifle, knots it like a piece of licorice.
HAGRID	72	Anyway, Harry. Got summat fer yeh. ’Fraid I mighta sat on it at some point, but ’magine it'll taste all right jus' the same...let's see now...got it here somewhere...
HAGRID	73	Baked it meself, words an' all.
HARRY	74	Thank you.
HAGRID	75	14. Well, it's not ev' ry day yer young mein turns ’leven. Hagrid turns to the fireplace, gives the embers a poke with
HARRY	76	Excuse me, but.. .who are you? Harry stares blankly. Hagrid frowns.
HAGRID	77	Blimey, Harry, did yeh never wonder where yer parents learnt it all?
HARRY	78	Learned what?
HAGRID	79	What? DURSLEY!!! Do yeh mean ter tell me the boy knows nothin?
HAGRID	80	’Harry, yer a wizard. For a moment, the hut is utterly silent.
HARRY	81	I'm a what?
HAGRID	82	A Wizard. And a thumpin' good 'un, I'd wager, once yeh've been trained up a bit.
HARRY	83	No. You've made a mistake. I...I can't be a...wizard. I mean...I'm just...Harry. Just Harry.
HAGRID	84	Tha' right. Tell me, Harry. Ever make somethin' strange 'appen? When yeh was scared maybe. Or angry? As Harry looks up in recognition, Hagrid slaps a soggy ENVELOPE into Harry's hand. Harry opens it, reads.
HARRY	85	15. 'Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry...' As Harry looks up, Hagrid winks, and takes a bite of sausage.
UNCLE VERNON	86	He'll not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish!
HARRY	87	You knew? You knew I'm a...a wizard?
AUNT PETUNIA	88	Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being
HARRY	89	Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash.
HAGRID	90	CAR CRASH! A car crash kill Lily and James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal!
UNCLE VERNON	91	HE'LL NOT BE GOING, I TELL YOU!
HAGRID	92	An' I s'ppose a great Muggle like
HARRY	93	Muggle?
HAGRID	94	16. Non-magic folk.
UNCLE VERNON	95	I will not pay for some crackpot
HAGRID	96	NEVER..INSULT...ALBUS...DUMBLEDORE. ..IN...FRONT...OF..ME! Hagrid spins, points the umbrella at Uncle Vernon, then spies Dudley, one hand deep in Harry's birthday cake. POP!—a FLASH of VIOLET LIGHT hits Dudley square in the rump. Instantly, a
HAGRID	97	Tha’s curious. Meant ter turn ’im into a complete pig, whole hog an
HAGRID	98	Er, be grateful if yeh didn't mention that to anyone at Hogwarts. Strictly speakin', I'm not allowed ter do magic.
HAGRID	99	T'Less, o' course, yeh'd rather stay.
HARRY	100	'First year students will require three sets of plain work robes, one plain pointed hat for day wear, one pair of dragon-hide gloves...'
HAGRID	101	Things these Muggles dream up...
HARRY	102	'...and the following Set Books: The Standard Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk. One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore...'
HARRY	103	'One wand, one standard Size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if
HAGRID	104	If yen know where to go.
BARTENDER	105	18. Hagrid! The usual, I presume—
HAGRID	106	Professor! Didn't see yeh there. Harry, this 'ere's Professor Quirrell. He'll be yer Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.
QUIRRELL	107	F-F-Fearfully f-fascinating subject. N-Not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter? Quirrell's eyes flutter nervously over Harry's scar.
HAGRID	108	Yes, well, must get on. Lots ter buy.
HARRY	109	Why am I famous, Hagrid? All those
HAGRID	110	Don' know that I'm the right one ter tell yeh that, Harry. Let's see now...Three up...Two across...Right. Stand back now. 19. Hagrid gives the wall one last 'TAP and the bricks QUIVER, wriggling and jiggling until an ARCHWAY appears, giving out on a COBBLED STREET so long and twisting it seems never to end. As Harry's jaw drops, Hagrid grins.
HAGRID	111	Welcome, Harry. To Diagon Alley.
PLUMP WOMAN	112	Seventeen Sickles an ounce for Dragon Liver, can you imagine? They're mad!
MOTHER	113	It says brass, Trevor. As such, you will get brass,
BOY	114	There it is! The Nimbus Two Thousand! Runs a good twenty times faster than the old Comets. Neil Marks himself rides it for the Chudley Cannons.
FATHER	115	Mind you don't drop your bottle of eel's eye, Belinda, I'll not buy you another.
HARRY	116	You'd like a dragon?
HAGRID	117	Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry. Vastly misunderstood... 20.
HAGRID	118	There's yer money. Gringotts. Wizard's Bank. No place safer, Harry. Not one. 'Cept perhaps Hogwarts.
HARRY	119	Uh, Hagrid, what exactly was that?
HAGRID	120	Yer basic Door Goblin. Clever as
HAGRID	121	Let's see, got it 'ere somewhere...
HAGRID	122	Ah, 'ere's the li'l devil.
GOBLIN	123	21. Very well. I'll have Griphook take you.
HAGRID	124	Din' think yer parents would leave yeh with nothin', did yeh?
GRIPHOOK	125	Vault Seven Hundred Thirteen.
HARRY	126	What's in here, Hagrid?
HAGRID	127	Can’t tell yeh that, Harry. Hogwarts business. Very secret.
HAGRID	128	Anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door.
HARRY	129	How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?
GRIPHOOK	130	About once every ten years. 22.
HAGRID	131	Best not mention this ter anyone either, Harry.
HARRY	132	I still need...a wand.
OLLIVANDER	133	I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. Seems only yesterday your mother and father we're in
OLLIVANDER	134	No. Apparently not. Perhaps this.
OLLIVANDER	135	23. No. No. Definitely not. No Matter. After all...it's the wand that chooses the wizard.
OLLIVANDER	136	I wonder... Ollivander descends, presents a box. Stifling a yawn, Harry
OLLIVANDER	137	Go on then.
OLLIVANDER.	138	Curious. Very curious...
HARRY	139	Sorry, but what's curious?
OLLIVANDER	140	I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It's curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother...
HARRY	141	And who owned that wand?
HAGRID	142	We don't speak his name, Harry.
OLLIVANDER	143	24. As I said, the wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it's clear we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named did great things. Ollivander slides the lid on the box, hands it to Harry.
OLLIVANDER	144	Terrible, yes. But great.
HAGRID	145	Happy Birthday, Harry.
HAGRID	146	Crikey, yeh'd think yeh hadn't gotten a birthday present before.
HARRY	147	I haven't. Not really.
HAGRID	148	You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet.
HAGRID.	149	25. 'Course I know. Who do yeh think carried yeh out o' yer parents' house, Hallowe'en night, ten years ago? Who do yeh think brought yeh
HAGRID	150	Firs', un'erstand this, 'cause it's important: not all yer wizards are good. Some go bad. Years ago, there was this one wizard who went as bad as you could go. His name was...was...
HARRY	151	Maybe if you wrote it down.
HAGRID	152	Nah—can' spell it. All right— Voldemort.
HARRY	153	Voldemort?
HAGRID	154	Dark days those were, Harry. Volde...You-Know-Who...started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em too.
HARRY	155	Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
HAGRID	156	That's no ord'nary cut on your forehead. A mark like that only comes when yeh've been touched by a curse. An evil curse. Just then, a HIGH, CACKLING VOICE pierces the silence. Harry turns, sees an OLD WOMAN laughing with the gummy bartender.
HARRY	157	26. But what happened to Vol...to You- Know-Who?
HAGRID	158	Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. I reckon he's out there somewhere, jus' too weak to carry on. But one thing's fer certain, Harry. Somethin' about you stumped
HAGRID	159	You're the boy who lived.
HAGRID	160	Blimey, look at the time. 'Fraid I 'ave ter be leavin' yeh now, Harry.
HAGRID	161	He'll be wantin' ter see me.
HARRY	162	There must be something wrong,
HARRY	163	...Is there? 27.
HARRY	164	Excuse me. Can you tell me where I might find Platform Nine and Three- Quarters.
MRS. WEASLEY	165	All right, Percy. You first.
MRS. WEASLEY	166	Fred. You next.
FRED	167	I'm not Fred. I'm George. Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?
MRS. WEASLEY	168	Sorry, George.
FRED	169	Only joking. I am Fred.
HARRY	170	Excuse me. Could you tell me—
MRS. WEASLEY	171	28. How to get onto the platform? Not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.
MRS. WEASLEY	172	"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between Platforms Nine and Ten. Focus...but don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it either. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
NEVILLE	173	Gran! I've lost my toad again.
GRAN	174	Oh, Neville. Honestly. Not again... Further up, a BOY IN DREADLOCKS (LEE JORDAN) holds a BOX.
STUDENT	175	Go on, Lee. Give us a look. As Lee lifts the LID, a LONG HAIRY LEG protrudes and students SHRIEK. Unimpressed, one of the twins spots Harry struggling.
GEORGE	176	Want a hand?
HARRY	177	Yes, please. 29.
GEORGE	178	Oy! C'mere, Fred! Take a handle.
HARRY	179	Thanks very much.
GEORGE	180	Blimey. You're...
HARRY	181	What? Oh, him. Yes. I mean, I am.
MRS. WEASLEY	182	Fred! George! Come say goodbye to Ginny.
PERCY	183	Have to go, Mother. The other Prefects are expecting me up front.
FRED	184	Mum! Guess who’s on the train? Right now. FRED/GEORGE
GINNY	185	Oh, Mum, can I go on and see him? Please.
MRS. WEASLEY	186	Certainly not. The boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. 30.
MRS. WEASLEY	187	You two watch out for your brother. And behave yourselves this year..If I get one more owl telling me you've blown up a toilet or something--
FRED	188	Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.
GEORGE	189	Great idea, though, thanks, Mum!
RON	190	Mind? Everywhere else is full.
HARRY	191	Not at all.
RON	192	I’m Ron, by the way.
HARRY	193	I heard. I’m Harry.
RON	194	I...heard. 31.
RON	195	Wicked.
HARRY	196	Are all your family wizards?
RON	197	Huh? Oh. I think so. Well, Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant. But we never talk about him. I heard you went to live with
RON	198	Five. I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others. But if I do, it's no big deal because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes. Charlie's old wand. Even Scabbers used to be Percy's...
RON	199	Hardly ever wakes up. He's useless basically. Percy got an owl for making Prefect, but Mum and Dad couldn't afford-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead. Roh looks embarrassed. Just then, a DIMPLED WOMAN pushing a
DIMPLED WOMAN	200	Anything off the trolley, dears?
HARRY	201	We'll take the lot. CLOSE UP: TROVE OF TREATS
HARRY	202	'Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans'?
RON	203	That's rotten luck. They've only
HARRY	204	I've gotten Dumbledore!
RON	205	I've about six of him. Trade you Scabbers though, if you get Agrippa or Ptolemy. 33.
RON	206	Thought he'd be older, did you?
HARRY	207	No--I--Hey, he's gone. Harry holds up the cardn-now blank--to Ron, who only shrugs.
RON	208	Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?
HARRY	209	It's just, in the Muggle world, people stay put in photos.
RON	210	Pathetic, isn't it? Fred gave me a
HERMIONE	211	Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named
RON	212	Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. Scabbers SNORTS, but otherwise remains fat, grey, and asleep.
HERMIONE	213	Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example...
HERMIONE	214	Goodness. You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I know all about you, of course. I was doing a little recreational reading and you're in Modern Magical History, The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the 20th Century.
HARRY	215	Am I?
HERMIONE	216	Didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me.
HERMIONE	217	There. That's better, isn't it? I'm Hermione Granger, by the way. And you are...?
RON	218	Um...Ron Weasley.
HERMIONE	219	35. Pleasure. Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I'm hoping for Gryffindor--I hear Dumbledore himself was in it--but I think I
HAGRID	220	Firs' years! Firs' years over here!
HAGRID	221	You there! Don' be trailin' yer fingers in the water. Yeh might find yeh don' get 'em all back.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	222	Welcome to Hogwarts. In a moment, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates, but before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your Houses.
NEVILLE	223	Trevor!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	224	...will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily.
HARRY	225	How exactly do they sort us?
RON	226	Some kind of test, I think. Fred says it hurts like hell, but I'm sure he was joking. At least...I
MALFOY	227	37. It's true then, what they were saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. Harry's eyes slide, appraise the other two boys.
MALFOY	228	Oh. This is Crabbe and Goyle. And my name's Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.
MALFOY	229	Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, freckles, and a hand-me-ddwn robe-- you must be a Weasley.
HARRY	230	I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.
HERMIONE	231	Well, he's rather disagreeable,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	232	We are ready for you.
HERMIONE	233	38. It's not real, the ceiling. It's only bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	234	Before we begin, Professor
HERMIONE	235	I hear he's a genius. As the applause subsides, the hat TWITCHES. At the brim, a rip OPENS WIDE, and the hat begins to TALK.
SORTING HAT	236	Oh, you may not think I'm pretty But don't judge on what you see I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. There's nothing hidden in your head The
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	237	When I call your name, you will come forth, put on the hat and be sorted.
HERMIONE	238	Oh dear. Here it is, isn't it? The moment. Goodness. What if the hat says nothing and we're all just left standing here forever... 39.
SORTING HAT	239	GRYFFINDOR!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	240	Draco Malfoy.
RON	241	Slytherin. Draco Malfoy swaggers forth and grips the hat. He's barely
SORTING HAT	242	SLYTHERIN!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	243	Susan Bones. As SUSAN BONES dashes up front, Harry glances to the High Table. Dumbledore watches the proceedings placidly, while
HARRY	244	Ouch!
RON	245	Harry? What is it?
HARRY	246	N-nothing. I'm fine.
SORTING HAT	247	40. Hufflepuff! As Susan Bones runs off...
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	248	Ronald Weasley. As Ron steps nervously away, Harry glances back to the High
SORTING HAT	249	Gryffindor!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	250	If you will, Mr. Potter.
SORTING HAT	251	Hmmm. Difficult. Very Difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you...?
SORTING HAT	252	Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that... No? Well, if you're sure better be GRYFFINDOR! A ROAR erupts from the Gryffindor table. Harry stands shakily
SEAMUS	253	I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle, Mam's a witch. Bit of a
HARRY	254	Say, Percy. Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
PERCY	255	Hm? Oh. Professor Snape. Head of Slytherin House.
PERCY	256	Potions. But everyone knows it's
PERCY	257	Hello, Sir Nicolas. Have a nice summer?
NEARLY HEADLESS NICK	258	Dismal. What with the Slytherins winning the House Cup six years in a row, the Bloody Baron's become unbearable.
NEARLY HEADLESS NICK	259	Then again, he's always been unbearable.
RON	260	42. I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick.
NEARLY HEADLESS NICK	261	I prefer Sir Nicolas, if you don't mind.
NEARLY HEADLESS NICK	262	Like this.
DUMBLEDORE	263	If I may, I have a few start-of- term notices to announce. First Years should note that the. Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all pupils. Also, our caretaker, Mr.
DUMBLEDORE	264	...no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. And finally, please note that this year, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Hearing this, Ron stops chewing for the first time, glances at Harry. But before either can speak...
DUMBLEDORE	265	And now, let us sing the school
SCHOOL SINGING	266	Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us things worth knowing Bring back what we've forgot. Just do your best, we'll do the rest And learn until our brains all rot...
PERCY	267	This is the most direct path to the dormitory, except on Fridays, of course, when the staircases...change.
PERCY	268	Gryffindors, I give you Peeves, Hogwarts resident poltergeist. POP! A tiny translucent man with wicked eyes and wide mouth
PEEVES	269	Oooh! Ickle Firsties! What fun!
PINK LADY	270	Password?
PERCY	271	Caput Draconis. The portrait SWINGS FORWARD, revealing a ROUND HOLE in the wall. The students all scramble through it, into the...
PERCY	272	Girls' dormitory to the left. Boys to the right. You'll find your belongings have already been brought up. Any questions?
RON	273	This is Staircase Twelve North, which should take us to Backward Staircase Seven—no wait a minute, we're on Backward Staircase Seven... 45.
HARRY	274	How many staircases are there?
HERMIONE	275	One hundred forty-two, though, in A History of Magic, Bathilda Bagshot makes unattributed reference to three others.
RON	276	I hate her.
RON	277	Whew! We made it, mate. Can you imagine old McGonagall's face if we were late first day out... Hearing this, the cat narrows its eyes, leaps up and...TRANSFORMS...into old McGonagall herself. Ron's mouth drops open in amazement.
RON	278	That was bloody brilliant!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	279	Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. But perhaps it might be more useful if I transfigured Mr. Potter or yourself into a pocket watch. That way one of you might be on time.
HARRY	280	We got lost.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	281	Then perhaps a map. I trust you don't need one to find your seats?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	282	46. Transfiguration is some of the most complex, dangerous and valuable magic you will learn at Hogwarts. Use it skillfully and it may, one day, save your life. Make a mistake and you could find yourself with a toad's head and a monkey's tail.
SNAPE	283	There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...
SNAPE	284	Mr. Potter. Our hew...celebrity. Tell me. What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
SNAPE	285	You don't know. Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar? 47.
HARRY	286	I don't know, sir.
SNAPE	287	And the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
HARRY	288	I don't know, sir.
SNAPE	289	Pity. Clearly fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter.
HARRY	290	Clearly Hermione knows. It seems a
SNAPE	291	Silence! And put your hand down, you silly girl!
SNAPE	292	For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is know as the Draught of the Living Dead. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As
SNAPE	293	And Gryffindors. Note that five points will be taken from your House for your classmate's cheek.
SEAMUS	294	Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...
HARRY	295	What’s Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
RON	296	Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday before it... PFFFT! BLUE FLAMES shoot over the rim of the glass.
RON	297	Hey look! Neville's gotten a Remembrall!
HERMIONE	298	I've read about those. If the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten something.
NEVILLE	299	Only problem is...I can't remember what I've forgotten. Harry, Daily Prophet in hand, nudges Ron.
HARRY	300	Hey, Ron. Somebody broke into Gringotts! Listen: 'Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowleging the breach, insist nothing was taken. The vault in question had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day.' That’s odd. 49.
RON	301	It’s mad. Dad says there are dragons guarding some of the vaults.
HARRY	302	No. It’s just odd...That’s the day
MADAME HOOCH	303	Welcome to your first Flying Lesson. Well, what are you all waiting for? Everyone step up to a broomstick. Come now. Hurry up.
MADAME HOOCH	304	Stick out your right hand, Over the broom, and say "Up"!
MADAME HOOCH	305	Now. Once you’ve got hold of the broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight. We don't want you sliding off the end.
SEAMUS	306	Lost 'em, ma'am.
MALFOY	307	Excuse me, Madam Hooch. Given that a few of us have been on sticks for years, would it not make sense to separate the expert flyers from...
MADAME HOOCH	308	Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, but I’m sure even an expert flyer such as yourself can appreciate the benefits of reacquainting oneself with the basics. Your grip, for example. It's thumb in, not out. As Malfoy reddens, Harry and Ron share a grin.
MADAME HOOCH	309	Very well. Now when I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground. Hard. Keep your brooms steady, hover for a moment, then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...Three...Two... Jumping the gun entirely, a nervous Neville shoots straight up into the air, like a cork out of a bottle.
MADAME HOOCH	310	Mr. Longbottom! Exactly where do you think you're going?
MADAME HOOCH	311	Come down here this instant!
MADAME HOOCH	312	On your broomstick, Longbottom! Too late. With a giant THUD and a nasty CRACK, Neville hits the pitch. Madame Hooch and the Gryffindors rush over.
MADAME HOOCH	313	Broken wrist. Come on, dear. Up you get.
MALFOY	314	Did you see his face? Perhaps if the great lump had given this a
HARRY	315	Give it here, Malfoy.
MALFOY	316	No, I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about up a tree?
MALFOY	317	What's the matter, Potter? A bit beyond your reach?
HERMIONE	318	Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know how to...fly.
HARRY	319	Give it here. Or I'll knock you off that ruddy broom.
MALFOY	320	Is that so?
MALFOY	321	Have it your way, then! 52. Malfoy hurls the ball high. As it plummets, Harry throws himself into a steep dive, rocketing recklessly downward,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	322	HAR-RY POT-TER! Harry's stomach drops. Malfoy grins hideously.
MALFOY	323	Chin up, Potter. They might let you stay on as Hagrid's assistant.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	324	Excuse me, Professor Quirrell, could I borrow Wood for a moment. Startled, Professor Quirrell jumps, then OLIVER WOOD, a burly fifth-year, emerges, glances curiously at Harry.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	325	Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood...I've found you a Seeker.
RON	326	Seeker! But first years never make the House teams. You must be the youngest Quidditch player in--
HARRY	327	--a century. According to McGonagall. Just then, Fred and George descend.
FRED	328	53. Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us.
GEORGE	329	Our job to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.
FRED	330	Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally...
RON	331	Oh go on, Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game there is. And you'll be great too.
HARRY	332	But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
HERMIONE	333	You won't make a fool of yourself.
HERMIONE	334	It's in your blood.
RON	335	Harry...you didn't tell me your
HARRY	336	54. I...didn't know.
RON	337	I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
HARRY	338	Who doesn't?
RON	339	Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?
HERMIONE	340	We're not supposed to be here. This is the Third Floor. It's forbidden.
HERMIONE	341	Because Dumbledore said so. Let's go.
RON	342	That's it. We're done for.
HERMIONE	343	55. Oh, move over. Alohomora!
HERMIONE	344	Standard Book of Spells. Chapter Seven.
RON	345	Chapter Seven?
HERMIONE	346	Shhh! Filch is...gone.
HERMIONE	347	It was locked.
HARRY	348	And for good reason...
HERMIONE	349	56. You don't use yqur eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?
RON	350	I wasn't looking at its feet. I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three.
HERMIONE	351	It was standing on a trapdoor, which means-it's not there by accident. It's...
HARRY	352	Guarding something.
HERMIONE	353	That's right. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'll go to bed before either of you figures out another clever way to get us killed. Or worse...expelled.
WOOD	354	Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each team has seven players: Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and the Seeker— that's you. There are three kinds of balls. This one's called the Quaffle.
HARRY	355	I think so. What's in there?
WOOD	356	Here. Take this. 57. Wood hands Harry a SMALL CLUB, kneels before the crate, and unlashes a leather strap. Instantly, a BLACK BALL rockets into the sky, then, without warning, PLUMMETS straight down— at Harry's head. Startled, Harry jumps aside and—purely on instinct—clubs it back into the sky.
WOOD	357	Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. Careful now, it's coming back. As the ball screams back to earth, Wood crates it.
HARRY	358	What was that?
WOOD	359	Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you're a Seeker. The only ball I want you to worry about is...this. Wood takes out a TINY BALL about the size of a walnut. BRIGHT GOLD, it has little, fluttering WINGS.
HARRY	360	I like this ball.
WOOD	361	You like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
HARRY	362	What do I do with it?
WOOD	363	Catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter...we win.
PROFESSOR FLITWICK	364	Now don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been, practising. Swish and flick. Swish and flick.
HARRY	365	Wingardium Leviosa. The feather flutters, but never leaves the table.
PROFESSOR FLITWICK	366	And enunciate! Never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor
RON	367	WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!
HERMIONE	368	Honestly. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-ohhhh- sa. Not Levi-o-saaaah.
RON	369	You do it then, if you're so clever.
HERMIONE	370	Wingardium Leviosa. Hermione swishes and flicks. Instantly the feather rises.
PROFESSOR FLITWICK	371	Oh, well done! Everyone see here. Miss Granger's done it! PFFFT! Across the room, SMOKE curls between Seamus and Harry.
HARRY	372	I think we’re going to need another feather over here, Professor.
RON	373	It'sLevi-ohhhhh-sa. Not Levi-o- saaaah. She's a nightmare,
HARRY	374	I think she heard you.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	375	How are you, Potter? All right?
HARRY	376	Yes, Professor. Fine.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	377	I know...that is, we know...the members of the staff...that this is perhaps a difficult night for you. Halloween. Your parents...
HARRY	378	I'm all right, Professor.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	379	Very well.
HARRY	380	Professor...Thank you.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	381	You're welcome, Potter.
QUIRRELL	382	TROLL IN THE DUNGEON! TROLL IN THE 60. DUNGEON ! Thought you ought to know...
DUMBLEDORE	383	Everyone will please not panic. Prefects, lead your Houses back to the dormitories. Teachers, follow me to the dungeons.
HARRY	384	How could a troll get in?
RON	385	Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably Peeves' playing jokes...
HARRY	386	That's the third-floor he's going to. Teachers were supposed to go to the dungeons...
RON	387	Smells like Fred's socks. Only...worse.
HARRY	388	Follow me. Harry edges forward, pulls the SWORD from the suit of armor, and runs it through the door handle, trapping the troll.
RON	389	Yes!
HARRY	390	This wouldn't be the girl's bathroom, would it? CUT TO: CLOSE UP — HERMIONE SCREAMING
RON	391	Don't worry, Hermione! We're here!
HERMIONE	392	I heard that! 62.
RON	393	What do we do?
RON	394	Confuse it?
RON	395	Wingardium Leviosa.
RON	396	Wingardium LEVI-OHHHH-SA! With that, the club quivers upon the floor...begins to rise.
HERMIONE	397	Is it--dead?
HARRY	398	I don't think so. Just knocked out.
RON	399	No need to kill it, after all.
HARRY	400	Yes, well, that was big of you. Ugh. Troll snot.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	401	Explain yourselves! Both of you.
HERMIONE	402	It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	403	Miss Granger!
HERMIONE	404	I went looking for the troll. I've read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	405	64. I'm very disappointed in you, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your very serious lack of judgement. As for you gentlemen, I hope you realize just how lucky you are. Not many First Years could take on a full grown maintain troll and live to tell the tale. I award each of you five points...for sheer dumb luck.
HARRY	406	Good of her to get us out of trouble like that.
RON	407	Mind you, we did save her from a full grown mountain troll.
HARRY	408	Mind you, she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the
RON	409	What are friends for?
RON	410	Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.
HERMIONE	411	Ron's right, Harry. You're going to need your strength today.
HARRY	412	I'm not hungry.
HERMIONE	413	That was...disturbing.
RON	414	I tell you what's disturbing. Snape smiling.
HARRY	415	That explains the blood...
HERMIONE	416	Blood?
HARRY	417	Last night, Ron and I saw Snape heading for the third floor. I'm
HERMIONE	418	But why would anyone go near that dog?
HARRY	419	Listen. The day I was at Gringotts,
HERMIONE	420	So you're saying...
HARRY	421	That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
RON	422	"But what's safer than Gringotts?
HARRY	423	One place, according to Hagrid. Hogwarts. 66.
HERMIONE	424	Well, whatever it is, it must be really valuable.
HARRY	425	Or really dangerous. Just then, an OWL beats into the room.
HERMIONE	426	Bit early for mail, isn't it?
HARRY	427	That's Hedwig.
HARRY	428	It's a broomstick.
RON	429	That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand.
HARRY	430	But who...? Harry glances up, sees—far across the room--Professor
WOOD	431	I know what you're thinking, Harry. I'm playing my first game of Quidditch, the entire school's watching me and, worst of all, it's against Slytherin. Am I right?
HARRY	432	Pretty close.
WOOD	433	It's all right. I felt the same way before my first game. 67.
HARRY	434	What happened?
WOOD	435	I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head about two minutes in and woke up in the hospital a week later.
MADAME HOOCH	436	Now, I want a nice clean game. From all of you.
ANGELINA	437	Marcus Flint. Slytherin Captain.
MADAME HOOCH	438	Mount your brooms, please. Hands trembling, Harry waits, then the WHISTLE BLASTS. FOURTEEN BROOMSTICKS rise into the air. As the crowd ROARS, Madam Hooch kicks the crate, releasing two SCREAMING Bludgers, then tosses up the Quaffle. In the stands, LEE JORDAN does COMMENTARY.
LEE JORDAN	439	Quaffle's up...and straight off taken by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor. What an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive too, I might add.
HAGRID	440	Budge up there. Clear the way. How's Harry holdin' up?
HARRY	441	The Snitch!
HAGRID	442	69. Dunno what Harry thinks he's doin'. If I didn't know better, I'd say
RON	443	Maybe something happened to it when
HAGRID	444	No. Can't nothin' interfere with a broomstick except, powerful Dark magic. No kid could do that to a Nimbus 2000. Hearing this, Hermione GRABS Hagrid's binoculars.
RON	445	Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
HERMIONE	446	Leave it to me. As Hermione dashes off, Ron turns the binoculars back to the sky. Harry hangs from the broom with two hands while Fred hovers nearby. George circles about ten feet below.
HARRY	447	What’s George doing?
FRED	448	Just in case you fall, George will...
HARRY	449	I knew I should have gone out for football.
GEORGE	450	What's football? 70.
MALFOY	451	Take a good look, lads. With any luck we'll be having Potter soup for supper— Just then, Hermione brushes past, sending Malfoy ass over tea kettle into Professor Quirrell in the row below. Reaching
RON	452	Come on, Hermione... Just then, BLUE FLAMES spit from Hermione's wand, climbing quickly up Snape's robes. Snape continues to mutter, staring skyward, then realizes he's on fire, and looks away. In the commotion, that ensues, Ron sees Hermione scoop the blue fire
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	453	Well, that's unfortunate. Understandable, but unfortunate.
HAGRID	454	Unfortunate nothin'. He's got the Snitch! 71.
MADAME HOOCH	455	Thank you, Miss Granger. We can dispense with the more unattractive historical details of the game. Nevertheless, your point is well taken. Match to Gryffindor!
HAGRID	456	Rubbish! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
HAGRID	457	How do you know about Fluffy?
RON	458	Fluffy?
HERMIONE	459	That thing has a name?
HAGRID	460	72. 'Course he's got a name. He's mine. Bought him off an Irish bloke I met
HARRY	461	Yes?
HAGRID	462	Don' be askin' me anymore. That's top secret, that is.
HARRY	463	But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.
HAGRID	464	Codswallop! Snape's a Hogwart's teacher.
HERMIONE	465	Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid. I've
HAGRID	466	Now listen to me, all three of yeh— yer meddlin' in things that shouldn't be meddled. It's dangerous. What that dog's guardin' is strictly betw'n Professor
HARRY	467	Nicolas Flamel. Why does that name sound familiar?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	468	Listen up! As the lake is frozen, all students going home for holiday will take a flying sleigh to the departure platform. Earmuffs are strongly recommended.
BISHOP	469	Don't send me there! Can't you see his Knight? Send him. We can afford
RON	470	Queen to pawn six.
HERMIONE	471	Oh my god! That's barbaric!
RON	472	That's chess. I see you're packed.
HERMIONE	473	I see you're not.
RON	474	Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.
HERMIONE	475	You can help Harry then. He promised to keep looking in the library for Nicolas Flamel over holiday.
RON	476	We have looked. A hundred times. 74.
RON	477	I think we've had a bad influence
RON	478	Happy Christmas, Harry!
HARRY	479	I've got presents.
RON	480	What'd you expect? In your hand's from Hagrid. And by the looks of that lumpy one, Mum's sent you a Weasley sweater.
HARRY	481	'Your father left this in my
HARRY	482	It's some kind of...cloak.
RON	483	Well, let's see then. Put it on. As Harry takes the cloth, we hang on Ron, watching, then:
RON	484	Ahhh! Harry's head is floating in midair. Ron looks on in awe.
RON	485	75. Harry, do you know what this is? It’s an invisibility cloak. They're really rare. Who gave you this?
HARRY	486	There's no name...It just says, 'Use it well.'
HARRY	487	Flamel. Nicolas Flamel...
SNAPE	488	Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s, yet?
QUIRRELL	489	B-b-but Severus, I— 76.
SNAPE	490	You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrel.
QUIRRELL	491	I don’t know what you—
SNAPE	492	You know perfectly well what I mean. Your little bit of hocus pocus...
SNAPE	493	We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decide where your loyalties lie.
FILCH	494	Professors... I found this. In the Restricted Section. It's still hot.
HARRY	495	Ah! Harry turns—as if expecting to see someone--but finds only
HARRY	496	Mum? Dad?
HARRY	497	Ron! Ron! Wake up!
HARRY	498	There's something you've got to see!
HARRY	499	Come look! It's my family.
HARRY	500	Look in properly, go on, stand here.
HARRY	501	There. You see them, don't you? That's—
RON	502	Me. Only I'm...Head Boy! And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup and...bloody hell...I'm Quidditch Captain too! Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
RON	503	Want to play chess?
HARRY	504	No.
RON	505	Want to go visit Hagrid?
HARRY	506	No.
RON	507	Harry, I know what you're thinking. But don't. There's something not right about that mirror.
DUMBLEDORE	508	I see that you—like so many before you—have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I expect by now you realize what it does.
HARRY	509	It shows me my family.
DUMBLEDORE	510	And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.
DUMBLEDORE	511	I don't need a cloak to become invisible.
HARRY	512	So, then, it shows us what we want... Whatever we want...
DUMBLEDORE	513	Yes and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your
HARRY	514	Can I ask you something, Professor? What do you see when you look in the Mirror?
DUMBLEDORE	515	I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks. One can never have enough socks, Harry. You'll do well to remember that as well.
HERMIONE	516	I'll ask you again. What are the three most Crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
RON	517	And I'll tell you again. I forgot.
HERMIONE	518	And what, may I ask, do you plan to do should you get that question on final exams?
RON	519	Crib off you.
HERMIONE	520	You will not. Besides, according to
RON	521	You’ve got to start standing up to
NEVILLE	522	How? I can't stand up at all.
SEAMUS	523	I offered to do the countercurse,
NEVILLE	524	Of course not. That's all I need, you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire.
SEAMUS	525	I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back. As Seamus turns away, the others see a curious BALD SPOT on
RON	526	All right then, Neville, who shall it be? Me, Hermione, or...
RON	527	He's bowling. So what? He's always bowling.
RON	528	'Dumbledore is particularly famous
HARRY	529	I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day. 82.
HERMIONE	530	Follow me.
NEVILLE	531	Hey! Wait! What about that counter- curse! Neville1 eyes shift. Seamus smiles, raises an eyebrow.
HERMIONE	532	How could I be so stupid! I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
RON	533	This is light?
HERMIONE	534	Of course! Here it is!
HERMIONE	535	Oh, honestly, don't you two read?
RON	536	Immortal.
HERMIONE	537	It means you'll never die. 83.
RON	538	I know what it means—
HERMIONE	539	’The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who
HARRY	540	So Flamel knows someone's after the Stone...gives it to Dumbledore to keep safe at Hogwarts...not realizing that the one who's after it...
HERMIONE	541	Teaches at Hogwarts.
RON	542	So Snape wants piles of gold and to live forever. Who wouldn't?
HARRY	543	What is it, Hermione?
HERMIONE	544	I don't want to scare you, Harry. It's just...if all Snape wants is
HAGRID	545	Oh. Hullo. Er...not ter be rude, but I'm not really fit ter entertain right about-- 84.
HARRY	546	We know about the Sorcerer's Stone.
HAGRID	547	Snape! Blimey, yer not still on
HARRY	548	Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know...why.
HAGRID	549	Harry, Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. He's not abou' ter steal it.
HARRY	550	What?
HAGRID	551	Yeh heard me: Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. Now, as I said, I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment--
HARRY	552	Wait a minute. One of the teachers?
HERMIONE	553	Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments...
HAGRID	554	Tha's right. Bloody waste o' time if yeh ask me. T'ain't no one goin' ter get past Fluffy. Not a soul knows how 'cept me an' Dumbledore— CRACK! A CLICKING SOUND is heard coming from the kettle, then a curious SCRAPING. Harry looks. Sees a HUGE BLACK EGG.
HARRY	555	Hagrid...exactly what is that?
HAGRID	556	Ah. Well. That's...er... 85.
RON	557	I know what that is! But Hagrid. How did you ever get one?
HAGRID	558	Won it. Off a stranger in the
HERMIONE	559	Is that...a dragon?
RON	560	That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
HARRY	561	Norbert?
HAGRID	562	Well, he's got ter have a name. The dragon blinks at Hagrid, screws up its face and...SNEEZES, spewing forth a shower of SPARKS, which sends Fang whimpering and kindles a brief blaze in Hagrid's beard.
HAGRID	563	Needs ter be trained up a bit, o' Course,
HARRY	564	Malfoy!
RON	565	But it's crazy. And worse, Malfoy, knows.
HARRY	566	I don't understand. Is that bad?
RON	567	It's bad.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	568	As every schoolchild knows, dragon breeding is against our laws, has been ever since the Warlock's Convention of 1709. And for good reason. It's hard to keep the Muggles from noticing us if we've got a thirty-foot Ukranian Ironbelly running around the back garden.
RON	569	Norwegian Ridgeback.
RON	570	I just meant... in this case...sorry.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	571	87. Personally, I don’t care if Hagrid has a Chinese Fireball sitting in
HARRY	572	Fifty?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	573	Each. And to insure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.
MALFOY	574	Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four of us.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	575	Indeed. You see, Mr. Malfoy, however noble your intentions, you too were out of bed after hours. You will join your classmates in detention.
FRED	576	Don't worry, you three. This'll all blow over.
GEORGE	577	It may take a year or two, but eventually people will start talking to you again.
RON	578	Why bother? Even with Malfoy losing points, Slytherin's a lock for the House Cup. And look. Malfoy knows it.
FILCH	579	A sorry lot this, Hagrid. I pity you. Filch squints, sees tears running down Hagrid's face.
FILCH	580	Good god, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
HERMIONE	581	Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll
HAGRID	582	But what if Norbert doesn't like Romania. What if the other dragons
RON	583	A baby that breaths fire.
FILCH	584	For god's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the Forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.
MALFOY	585	The Forest? But I thought that was just a joke. We can't go in the Forest. Students aren't allowed. And there's...werewolves.
HAGRID	586	Sorry abou’ this, Harry. Know it’s me that deserves punishin’, not you. By all rights I should be sittin’ in a cell in Azkaban tonight. 90.
HARRY	587	It’s all right, Hagrid. Besides, it’s not your fault we were out after hours. If we hadn’t come knocking on your door in the middle of the night—
HAGRID	588	The reason we’re here.
HAGRID	589	It's unicorn blood. I found one dead a few weeks back and two before that first term. This one here's been hurt bad by summat. It's our job to find the poor thing. Only one way ter get that done and that's ter split inter two parties. Ron, Hermione—yeh'll come with me. Harry, yeh'll go with Malfoy.
MALFOY	590	I want Fang then.
HAGRID	591	Fine. But jus', so yeh know. He's a bloody coward.
MALFOY	592	Wait until my father hears about this. This is servant stuff. We should be writing lines or...something.
HARRY	593	91. If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
MALFOY	594	You're too stupid to be scared, Potter, growing up with Muggles. If you were from a real wizard family, you wouldn't be laughing.
HARRY	595	I'm not, believe me...
MALFOY	596	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Malfoy bolts, slipping and sliding as Fang whimpers after.
HARRY	597	What was that thing you saved me from?
FIRENZE	598	92. Only one who has nothing to lose would commit such a crime. It is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that-- from the moment the blood touches your lips-you will have a half life. A cursed life.
HARRY	599	But who would choose such a life?
FIRENZE	600	Can you think of no one?
HARRY	601	Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort!
FIRENZE	602	Do you know whatis hidden in the
HARRY	603	The Sorcerer’s Stone. AND FOR THE UK AUDIENCE...
HARRY	604	The Philosopher’s Stone... A commotion is heard as Hagrid and the others come slashing through the trees. As Harry reacts, the others break into the clearing.
HERMIONE	605	Harry!
HAGRID	606	Oh, it’s you, is it, Firenze. I see you’ve met our Mr. Potter. All right there, Harry?
RON	607	You mean...You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest!
HARRY	608	But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone
RON	609	But if he comes back, you don't think he'd try to...kill you? Do you?
HARRY	610	I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
RON	611	And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
HERMIONE	612	No. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
HERMIONE	613	I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of year exams were frightful. But I found that rather enjoyable. Weren’t you stunned not to be asked about Elfric the Eager?
RON	614	I'm stunned my head didn't explode. Alright there, Harry? 94.
HARRY	615	My scar. Keeps...burning.
HERMIONE	616	It's happened before...
HARRY	617	Not like this...
HARRY	618	No...
HERMIONE	619	Harry?
HARRY	620	Don't you think it's a bit odd, that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon? And a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before?
HARRY	621	Didn't that strike you as unusual?
HAGRID	622	Yeh meet a lot o' unusual types in the village. Ain't 'xactly usual meself.
HARRY	623	This stranger, though. You and he must've talked...
HAGRID	624	95. He asked what I did, the sorta creatures I look after. Tol' him after Fluffy a dragon wouldbe easy.
HAGRID	625	Well, yeah. How many three-headed dogs do yeh meet, even if yeh're in the trade? So I tells 'im, this stranger, the trick with any beast is ter know what calms 'em. Take Fluffy, fer example. Jus' play 'im a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep--
HAGRID	626	I shouldn'ta tol' yeh that! Forget I said it! Hey! Where yeh goin'! Hey!
HARRY	627	We have to see Professor Dumbledore. Immediately.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	628	I see. Well, I'm afraid Professor
HARRY	629	He's gone? Now? But this is important! This is about...the Sorcerer's Stone.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	630	How do you know--
HARRY	631	96. Someone's going to try and steal it.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	632	Nonsense. I don't know how you three found out about the Stone, but I assure you it is well protected. Now, run along.
HARRY	633	That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which
HERMIONE	634	And with Dumbledore gone...
SNAPE	635	Now what would three fine Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on such a lovely day?
HERMIONE	636	We were just...
SNAPE	637	You want to be careful. People will think you're...up to something. Snape eyes Harry, then turns away.
HERMIONE	638	What do we do now?
HARRY	639	Go through the trapdoor. Tonight.
RON	640	Trevor! Shh! Go! You shouldn't be here.
NEVILLE	641	Neither should you.
NEVILLE	642	You're sneaking out again, aren't you?
HARRY	643	Now, Neville, listen...
NEVILLE	644	No! I won't let you. You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again. I'll...I'll fight you! You were the ones who told me I had to stand up to people!
RON	645	To people. Not us.
HERMIONE	646	Neville. I'm really, really sorry about this.
RON	647	You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant. But scary.
PEEVES	648	Who's there? Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie? Nothing. Peeves smiles slyly, reaches back, and hurls one of the apples. It streaks through the air...then...disappears in mid-flight. Peeves smile fades.
PEEVES	649	Never mind.
HERMIONE	650	That was close.
RON	651	Sorry. I get hungry when I'm nervous.
RON	652	Wait a minute. He's...
HARRY	653	Snoring. Harry pushes the door further and the light from the corridor falls on a TINY HARP. Playing by itself.
HARRY	654	99. Suppose we won't be needing this now. Look, it's obvious Snape's already got past Fluffy. If you two want to go back—
RON	655	Don't be stupid.
HERMIONE	656	We're coming.
HARRY	657	Right then. All together now.
HARRY	658	I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. If something...bad happens...get yourselves out—
HERMIONE	659	The harp...what happened to the— Splat! Something wet and sticky hits Ron's shoulder.
RON	660	Yuck! What's this ruddy stuff—
RON	661	That was...cool.
HARRY	662	100. We must be miles under the school.
RON	663	Lucky this plant thing's here, really.
HARRY	664	WO! A vine snakes out Ron's back collar.
RON	665	Wo! Twin creepers encircle Harry's chest.
HERMIONE	666	Stop moving! Both of you! This is Devil's Snare! You have to relax.
HARRY	667	Uh, Hermione, it's a bit difficult to relax...
HERMIONE	668	I know, Harry. But you must. If you don't, it'll only kill you faster.
RON	669	Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax.
RON	670	What are we going to do now!
HARRY	671	I suggest we do what she says.
HARRY	672	Apparently not.
HERMIONE	673	Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. Dances in the dark, delights in the damp...
HERMIONE	674	It's deadly fun, but will...sulk in the sunl That's it! Light! Devil's Snare hates the light!
RON	675	Lucky we didn't panic.
HARRY	676	Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
HERMIONE	677	What is that?
HARRY	678	I don't know...sounds like wings.
HERMIONE	679	Curious. I've never seen birds like these...
HARRY	680	They're not birds...
HARRY	681	They're keys. And I'll bet one of
HERMIONE	682	103. Locked.
RON	683	Alohomora!
RON	684	Well, it was worth a try.
HERMIONE	685	What's wrong with its wing?
RON.	686	The feather's pinched. Probably from Snape catching it before us.
HERMIONE	687	Harry?
HARRY	688	It's...too simple.
RON	689	Oh, go on, Harry. If Snape could catch it on that old CleanSweep, you can. It's not for nothing you're the youngest Seeker in a Century.
RON	690	Well, this complicates things a bit. As Harry kicks into the air, a seething cluster of keys falls
RON	691	He'll be torn to pieces.. Horrified, Ron and Hermione watch Harry soar higher, fending
HERMIONE	692	I don't like this. I don't like this at all. A small bouquet of BLUE FLAMES blooms in Hermione's hands, illuminating little more than the trio's faces and some VAGUE SHAPES looming ahead.
HARRY	693	Where are we? A graveyard? 105. Harry steps forward and—suddenly--one of the SHAPES moves
RON	694	This is no graveyard... Ron takes an unlit torch from the wall, touches it to the
RON	695	It's a chessboard. Sure enough. As the chamber glows with light, a kind of battlefield is revealed, studded with faceless soldiers.
HERMIONE	696	But what're we to do? As Hermione takes a tentative step onto the board, a BISHOP'S
RON	697	It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play pur way across the room. Excuse me...are we meant to join you?
HARRY	698	Just tell us what to do.
RON	699	All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione— you'll be the Queenside castle. As for me... Ron leaps astride the only riderless horse.
RON	700	...I'll be a Knight.
HERMIONE	701	What happens now?
RON	702	We play. 106. Across the board, a WHITE PAWN moves forward two squares
HERMIONE	703	Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do you? Ron—contemplating something--doesn't answer immediately,
RON	704	You there...d5 As Ron's BLACK PAWN obliges, WHITE'S PAWN slides swiftly forth (to d5) and, with a THUNDEROUS collision, the black pawn EXPLODES, rubble raining to the ground.
RON	705	Yes, Hermione? I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess. DISSOLVE TO: ...the chess board, a real battlefield now, littered on both sides with fallen pieces. Ron, drained but intense, surveys the board, MUTTERING to himself.
RON	706	Think...Think.
HARRY	707	Wait a minute...
RON	708	107. There's just one problem with that. It's you that has to go on, Harry. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You.
HARRY	709	No, Ron...
HERMIONE	710	What is it?
HARRY	711	He's going to sacrifice himself.
HERMIONE	712	No. There has to be another way!
RON	713	Do you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone or not!
HARRY	714	No!
HARRY	715	If you can, go to the Owlery and send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on.
HERMIONE	716	You're a great wizard, Harry Potter! You are, you know!
HERMIONE	717	Me! Books. And cleverness. There are more important things— friendship and bravery and—-oh, Harry, be careful!
HARRY	718	You! The figure turns. It is Professor Quirrell.
HARRY	719	No. It can’t be. Snape...
HARRY	720	But that day, during the Quidditch match...Snape to kill me.
QUIRRELL	721	No, dear boy, I tried to kill you. And, trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would've succeeded.
QUIRRELL	722	Didn't know? Surprising, given how curious you are Potter. I knew you were a danger to me right off. Especially after Halloween.
HARRY	723	You let the Troll in.
QUIRRELL	724	Yes. I have a way with trolls. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was
QUIRRELL	725	Come here, Potter.
HARRY	726	I...I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.I...I've won the House Cup. VOICE (O.S.)
QUIRRELL	727	Tell the truth! What do you see! VOICE (O.S.)
QUIRRELL	728	Master, you are not strong enough. VOICE (O.S.) I have strength enough...for this.
VOLDEMORT	729	Yes. You see what I've become. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough...lies in your pocket.
VOLDEMORT	730	Don't be a fool, Harry. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join me...and live.
HARRY	731	Never!
VOLDEMORT	732	Ah, bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry...would you like to see your mother and father again?
VOLDEMORT	733	Together, we can bring them back. All I ask...is for something in return. Slowly, almost involuntarily, Harry removes the Stone from
VOLDEMORT	734	That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just...give me the Stone.
HARRY	735	Liar! Voldemort's eyes narrow.
QUIRRELL	736	Wh-what is this magic? Harry, breathing hard, follows Quirrell's gaze, stares in horror: Quirrell's fingers are slowly turning to dust.
VOLDEMORT	737	Fool! Get the Stone!
WIDE SHOT	738	113. Of Harry. Lying on the floor. The Stone glimmering dully in
DUMBLEDORE	739	Good afternoon, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE	740	Tokens from your admirers.
HARRY	741	Admirers?
DUMBLEDORE	742	What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret—so naturally the whole school knows. Your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your chocolate frogs. Though one suspects Agrippa and
HARRY	743	But what happened to the—
DUMBLEDORE	744	114. Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicolas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
HARRY	745	But then, Flamel...he'll die, won't
HARRY	746	But to destroy such a remarkable thing...
DUMBLEDORE	747	Yes, yes. As much money and life as one could ever want—the two things most human beings would choose above all else. Unfortunately, humans do have a knack for choosing precisely those things that are
HARRY	748	How is it I got the Stone, Sir? One minute I was stating in the mirror—
DUMBLEDORE	749	Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone—find it, but not use it— would be able to get it. One of my more brilliant ideas and, between you and me, that's saying something.
HARRY	750	Does that mean—with the Stone gone, that is—that Voldemort can never come back?
DUMBLEDORE	751	I'm afraid there are other ways for
DUMBLEDORE	752	Some people are like mirrors, Harry. They reflect our most desperate desires. We see what they want us to see. As painful as it surely was...you made the right choice.
DUMBLEDORE	753	Do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to touch you, Harry?
DUMBLEDORE	754	No, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. It is the very thing someone like
HARRY	755	What is it?
DUMBLEDORE	756	Love, Harry. Love. Dumbledore looks away then, smiles at Harry's treats.
DUMBLEDORE	757	Ah! Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee.
HARRY	758	All right there, Ron?
RON	759	All right. You?
HARRY	760	All right. Hermione?
HERMIONE	761	Never better.
RON	762	D'you think Dumbledore meant for it all to happen? And for you to do it? Sending you your father's cloak and all?
HERMIONE	763	Well, if he did—I mean—that's terrible. You could have been killed. Come to think of it, I could've been killed...
HARRY	764	I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here. The only thing I don't understand is Snape...
HARRY	765	117. Yes, of course. I was only
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	766	They were not compatible personalities, if that's what you mean. And then, of course, your
HARRY	767	What was that?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	768	I suppose he felt it his obligation ...to look after you this year.
RON	769	Of course! And now that he's
DUMBLEDORE	770	Another year gone! Now as I understand it, the House Cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus: tn fourth place, Gryffindor, with 312.
RON	771	You'd think saving the bloody
DUMBLEDORE	772	118. In third place, Hufflepuff, with 352. In second, Ravenclaw, with 426. And in first place, with 472 points...Slytherin House.
DUMBLEDORE	773	Yes, well done, Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. I have a few last minute points to award. The hall goes very STILL. The Slytherin smiles FADE a bit.
DUMBLEDORE	774	First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect when others were in grave peril... fifty points. As the Gryffindors cheer, Hermione looks overwhelmed.
DUMBLEDORE	775	Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years...fifty points..
PERCY	776	My youngest brother, you know!
DUMBLEDORE	777	Third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House...sixty points. The DIN is deafening as Hermione makes the calculations.
HERMIONE	778	Oh my goodness. We've tied Slytherin!
DUMBLEDORE	779	And finally...it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but even more to stand up to our friends. I therefore award 10 points to...Mr. Neville Longbottom. 119. As the room ROARS and the HOURGLASSES shift, a stunned
DUMBLEDORE	780	Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe a change of decoration is in order.
RON	781	Come on now, Harry.
HAGRID	782	Didn' think yeh'd be leavin' without sayin' goodbye, didya?
HAGRID	783	That there's fer you to open on the train. Which seems to be leavin', by the way.
HAGRID	784	Go on now. An' Harry? If tha' dolt of a cousin o' yers Dudley gives yeh any grief, yeh can always threaten ter give 'im a pair o' ears ter go with that tail of 'is. 120.
HARRY	785	But Hagrid. We're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
HAGRID	786	I do...
HERMIONE	787	Feels strange, doesn' t it? To be going home.
HARRY	788	I'm not going home...Not really.
PULL AWAY	789	...rising high above Hogsmeade Station, above the Dark Forest and Hogwarts Castle itself as the Scarlet Express glitters far below, making its way back to the Muggle world. Slowly, we...
