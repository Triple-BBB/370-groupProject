THRU THRU	1	5 5 6 A BLAZING SUN 6 TILT DOWN to a blistering summer sky. A TITLE CARD appears:
HARRY POTTER	2	and
HARRY	3	Hey "Big D." Beat up another ten year old?
DUDLEY	4	This one deserved it. 2.
HARRY	5	Four against one. Very brave.
DUDLEY	6	Yeah, well you're one to talk. Moaning in your sleep every night. At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
HARRY	7	What are you talking about?
DUDLEY	8	"Don't kill Cedric! Don't kill Cedric!" Who's Cedric--your boyfriend?
DUDLEY	9	"Dad! Help me, Dad!"
HARRY	10	Shut up. THUNDER CRACKS. The other boys peer uneasily at the sky.
DUDLEY	11	He's going to kill me, Mum!
HARRY	12	Shut up Dudley, I'm warning you--!
DUDLEY	13	Wh-what are you doing?
HARRY	14	I'm not doing anything.
HARRY	15	Oh no.
HARRY	16	Lumos!
HARRY	17	Accio!
HARRY	18	EXPECTO PATRONUM!
MRS. FIGG	19	Don't put away your wand, boy!
MRS. FIGG	20	Dementors, in Little Whinging! What's next, Giants trodding the M4? The whole world's gone topsy- turvy...!
HARRY	21	I don't understand. How do you know about--?
MRS. FIGG	22	After You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year did you expect him to let you wander around on your own? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent.
MRS. FIGG	23	Now: get inside and stay there. I expect someone will be in touch soon, but whatever happens: don't leave the house!
AUNT PETUNIA	24	Diddykins? Is that...
AUNT PETUNIA	25	DIDDY! VERNON, come quick! VERNON DURSLEY, standing in front of the open freezer eating from a carton of ice cream, looks up vaguely.
AUNT PETUNIA	26	We have to take him to Hospital!
UNCLE VERNON	27	Who did this to you, boy? Dudley's shaking finger rises at Harry. Vernon approaches, brandishing the dripping spoon.
UNCLE VERNON	28	Happy are we now?! You've finally
AUNT PETUNIA	29	Don't say that, Vernon! 6.
MAFALDA HOPKIRK	30	Dear Mr. Potter: The Ministry has received intelligence that at twenty-three minutes past six this evening you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle. As a clear violation of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, you are hereby expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hoping that you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
UNCLE VERNON	31	Justice. In the b.g., Dudley again heaves into the plant. 13 OMITTED 13
HARRY	32	Sorry, Hedwig... Harry turns...bends down to find the moving PHOTO of
HARRY	33	Cedric--!
MADEYE MOODY	34	Tonks--for God's sake...
TONKS	35	Very clean, these Muggles. Bit unnatural...
TONKS	36	Oh, this is better...
MADEYE MOODY	37	Rescuing you, of course.
HARRY	38	But where are we going? If I've been expelled from Hogwarts--
MADEYE MOODY	39	You haven't been--not yet, anyway. Kingsley, you take point.
HARRY	40	But--the letter said--
SHACKLEBOLT	41	--pending a formal hearing.
TONKS	42	Don't worry, Harry. We'll explain everything when we get back to Headquarters--
MADEYE MOODY	43	Shhh! Not here, Nymphadora.
TONKS	44	Don't. Call me. Nymphadora.
TONKS	45	Stop being so cheerful, Madeye-- he'll think we're not taking this seriously...
MADEYE MOODY	46	Get a move on, sonny!
BACK TO SCENE	47	--the facade finishes expanding into place with a gentle POP...as the STEREO THUDS on, unperturbed.
MRS. WEASLEY	48	Thank heavens you're all right...
MRS. WEASLEY	49	No time to explain. Upstairs, first door on the left!
KREACHER	50	...mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves...if my poor Mistress knew the scum they've let
HERMIONE	51	HARRY--!
HERMIONE	52	Are you all right? We overheard
HERMIONE	53	--and this hearing at the Ministry--it's just outrageous!
HARRY	54	Yeah, there's a lot of that going around. What is this place anyway?
RON	55	It's Headquarters...
HERMIONE	56	...of the Order of the Phoenix. It's a secret society; Dumbledore
HARRY	57	Couldn't have put any of this in a letter I suppose. I've gone all summer without any bloody news!
RON	58	We wanted to write mate, really we did--only--
HARRY	59	Only what?
HERMIONE	60	Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything.
FRED	61	Harry. 13.
GEORGE	62	Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
FRED	63	Don't bottle up your anger, Harry; let it out!
GEORGE	64	Anyway if you're all done shouting--
FRED	65	--want to hear something really interesting...?
HARRY	66	Snape's part of the Order? 14.
MRS. WEASLEY	67	Well! We'll be eating down in the kitchen-- Without warning Fred and George APPARATE--CRACK!--on
MRS. WEASLEY	68	JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERYTHING!
ARTHUR WEASLEY	69	You're sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us all quite a turn.
HARRY	70	Sirius.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	71	...this is most unusual...it seems Minister Fudge has called your hearing before the entire Wizengamot...
SIRIUS	72	It's a set-up. A chance to publicly discredit Harry.
LUPIN	73	I'm afraid you may be right, Padfoot...
HARRY	74	I don't understand. What does the Ministry of Magic have against me? Silence. Tonks and Ginny frown; Ron and Hermione exchange an apprehensive look. Sirius hesitates...
HARRY	75	But...why?
LUPIN	76	Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in
HARRY	77	So what's Voldemort been up to-- seeing as everyone's so
SIRIUS	78	We think he wants to build up his
SIRIUS	79	We think Voldemort may be after
HARRY	80	You mean...like a weapon?
MRS. WEASLEY	81	THAT'S ENOUGH!
HARRY	82	Good--I want to join. If Voldemort's building an army I want to fight.
LUPIN	83	I know, Harry. But for all you've been through, you're not an adult-- not yet.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	84	Trains under the ground! So ingenious, these Muggles...
ARTHUR WEASLEY	85	Well! Here we are. He gestures "after you" to the bewildered Harry, then
ARTHUR WEASLEY	86	I've never used the visitor's entrance before. This should be fun! 18.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	87	Sorry...let's see... M...A...G... I...C. For a moment nothing happens--and then the telephone box SHUDDERS, and with a dull GRINDING begins sinking into
BOB	88	'Morning Arthur.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	89	'Morning Bob.
ARTHUR WEASLEY	90	Interdepartmental memos. We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable. 19. Just before the gates close Shacklebolt hurries in. As
ARTHUR WEASLEY	91	Merlin's Beard. Thank you Kingsley.
HARRY	92	When is it?
ARTHUR WEASLEY	93	Five minutes ago. As Wizards automatically reach for hanging straps above
LIFT VOICE	94	Department of Mysteries. Mr. Weasley pulls Harry out of the lift--and turns down
ARTHUR WEASLEY	95	...now remember, during the hearing you must speak only when spoken too, and stay calm--you've done nothing wrong. As the Muggles say,
ARTHUR WEASLEY	96	Not allowed in, I'm afraid. Good luck, Harry.
FUDGE	97	Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August into offenses committed by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
FUDGE	98	Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to
DUMBLEDORE	99	--Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
FUDGE	100	Er. You got our message that the time and place of the hearing had been changed, did you?
DUMBLEDORE	101	I must have missed it. But due to
HARRY	102	No, but--
FUDGE	103	Do you deny it was in the presence of a Muggle, one Dursley Dudley?
HARRY	104	No, but--
FUDGE	105	--and you were aware you are forbidden to use magic outside school while under the age of seventeen?
HARRY	106	Yes, but--
HARRY	107	I only did it because of the Dementors!
AMELIA BONES	108	Dementors? In Little Whinging?
FUDGE	109	Clever. Muggles can't see Dementors. Highly convenient.
HARRY	110	I'm not lying! There were two of them, and if I hadn't--
FUDGE	111	Enough! I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story, but as you can produce no witnesses-- 22.
DUMBLEDORE	112	Pardon me, Minister, but as it happens...we can. ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
AMELIA BONES	113	Please describe the attack. What
MRS. FIGG	114	Well...one was very large, and the other rather skinny--
FUDGE	115	Not the boys, the Dementors.
MRS. FIGG	116	Oh. Right... Big...cloaked...
FUDGE	117	Now look here! Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical--!
DUMBLEDORE	118	Oh, I don't think any of us believe
UMBRIDGE	119	I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor. Dementors are, after all, under the control of
DUMBLEDORE	120	That would be disturbing indeed, Madame Undersecretary...which is why I'm confident the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two Dementors were so very far
DUMBLEDORE	121	Cornelius...I implore you to listen to reason. The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontravert--
FUDGE	122	HE'S. NOT. BACK! Silence! Fudge is quivering with rage; even Percy is taken aback. Dumbledore sighs deeply...then quietly addresses the Panel.
DUMBLEDORE	123	In the matter of Harry Potter: the law plainly states that magic may be used before Muggles in life- threatening situations.
FUDGE	124	Laws can be changed, Dumbledore.
DUMBLEDORE	125	Clearly--if it has become practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic.
AMELIA BONES	126	Those in favor of clearing the witness of all charges? 24.
AMELIA BONES	127	Those in favor of conviction?
FUDGE	128	Cleared of all charges. As the assembled adjourn Harry turns gratefully to Dumbledore--but the Headmaster is already sweeping away,
MADEYE MOODY	129	Are you barking mad? You'll blow
HARRY	130	Sirius! What are you doing here?! If somebody sees you--
HARRY	131	I just don't want to see you chucked back in Azkaban! 25.
SIRIUS	132	Being trapped in that house day and night is almost as bad. Worst part about being a fugitive is how bloody boring it is...
SIRIUS	133	Original Order of the Phoenix.
HARRY	134	You all look so young.
SIRIUS	135	We were.
HARRY	136	Neville's parents...
SIRIUS	137	It's been fourteen years...and still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad.
HARRY	138	I wish I could have known him...
HARRY	139	Sirius...Do you really think there's going to be a war? 26.
SIRIUS	140	It feels like it did before. Like
SIRIUS	141	You keep it. Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now...
THRU THRU	142	40 40
DRACO MALFOY	143	I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free, Potter. Better enjoy it while you can--I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it...
RON	144	It's only Malfoy, Harry. What'd you expect...?
HARRY	145	Just--stay away from me...
DRACO MALFOY	146	What'd I tell you--complete nutter. MOMENTS LATER. As the trio approach the rain-washed road we see a CARRIAGE; inside is CHO CHANG and several
HARRY	147	What is it?
RON	148	What's what?
HARRY	149	That. Pulling the carriage.
HERMIONE	150	Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself--like always.
LUNA	151	You're Harry Potter.
LUNA	152	I don't know who you are.
NEVILLE	153	Oh, nobody, really.
HERMIONE	154	What an interesting necklace.
LUNA	155	Oh thank you! It's a charm actually.
LUNA	156	Hungry. I hope there's pudding. As the carriage RATTLES off... 42 OMITTED 42
DUMBLEDORE	157	...We have two changes in staffing this year. We are pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly- Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures while Professor
DUMBLEDORE	158	...We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher--Professor Dolores Umbridge. REVEAL Umbridge--in pink Alice band and matching cardigan--sitting beside Trelawney. Harry is stunned. DUMBLEDORE (O.S.) [I'm sure I'm not alone in saying good luck, Professor...]
HERMIONE	159	You know her?
HARRY	160	She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.
DUMBLEDORE	161	...As usual, our Caretaker Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you--
UMBRIDGE	162	Hem, hem. 30. Umbridge rises, steps toward the podium. Momentarily taken aback, Dumbledore politely yields the floor, to a MURMUR of shocked surprise from both teachers and students.
UMBRIDGE	163	Thank you Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright happy faces smiling up at me...
UMBRIDGE	164	...progress for progress's sake must be discouraged. A balance then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation. We think she's done--the students EXHALE--
UMBRIDGE	165	--Let us preserve what must be preserved, perfect what can be perfected--and prune practices that ought to be prohibited.
DUMBLEDORE	166	Thank you Professor Umbridge; that was most...illuminating. As I was saying, Mr. Filch has asked me... 31. DUMBLEDORE (O.S.) [...to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are any number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch's office door. First-years ought to know that the Forest in
RON	167	Illuminating? What a load of waffle!
HERMIONE	168	There was important stuff hidden in that waffle.
HARRY	169	What's it mean?
HERMIONE	170	It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.
HARRY	171	Dean. Seamus. Good holiday?
DEAN THOMAS	172	All right. Better than Seamus's anyway.
SEAMUS	173	Me Mam didn't want me to come back. 32.
HARRY	174	Why not?
SEAMUS	175	Well...I suppose because of you.
SEAMUS	176	Nobody knows what really happened
HARRY	177	Then I guess you should read the Prophet like your stupid mother-- it'll tell you everything you need to know!
SEAMUS	178	Don't you have a go at my mother!
HARRY	179	I'll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar--!
SEAMUS	180	He's mad is what's going on! Do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who?
RON	181	As a matter of fact, I do! So unless you want a fistful of Weasley you'll shut your mouth!
RON	182	You all right?
HARRY	183	I said I'm fine, Ron!
RON	184	Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then.
UMBRIDGE	185	Good morning, children!
UMBRIDGE	186	Ordinary. Wizarding. Level. Examinations...
UMBRIDGE	187	Your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly... uneven. But you will be pleased to know that from now on you will be
HERMIONE	188	There's nothing in here about actually using defensive spells.
HERMIONE	189	But surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts--
UMBRIDGE	190	Wizards much older and cleverer than yourself have devised our new program of study. You will be learning about defensive spells in
HARRY	191	What use is that? If we're going to be attacked it won't be "risk free--" 35.
HARRY	192	And how's theory's supposed to prepare us for what's out there?
UMBRIDGE	193	There is nothing out there, dear. Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself?
HARRY	194	Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort?
UMBRIDGE	195	Let me make this quite plain. You have been told that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.
HARRY	196	It's not a lie. I saw him, I
UMBRIDGE	197	Detention, Mr. Potter!
HARRY	198	So according to you, Cedric Diggory
UMBRIDGE	199	Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
HARRY	200	It was murder. Voldemort killed him and you know it--!
UMBRIDGE	201	Enough.
THE FIGURE	202	Ripples past. It's strangely familiar--
HARRY	203	Jaw clenched, eyes rapidly moving in REM-sleep--ZZZZP--
THE FIGURE	204	Still closer...as we PAN to reveal HARRY making his way down a dark, torchlit corridor--we were looking at his REFLECTION, the distorted, broken effect caused by the ridges between the wall's shiny black tiles. As we PAN BACK to Harry's reflection it again crosses
TRELAWNEY	205	--a most important means of divination. For the inner eye sees sights to which the outer world is blind... 37.
TRELAWNEY	206	Oh! What are you doing here?
UMBRIDGE	207	Oh don't mind me, dear...
UMBRIDGE	208	Nothing whatsoever to worry about of course. Please, do go on. I'm just a fly on the wall...
TRELAWNEY	209	Yes. Well--
UMBRIDGE	210	Just one question dear. You've been in this post how long exactly?
TRELAWNEY	211	Nearly sixteen years.
UMBRIDGE	212	Quite a period...And it was
UMBRIDGE	213	Just one more thing. If it isn't too much bother, would you please... predict something for me? 38.
TRELAWNEY	214	Sorry?
UMBRIDGE	215	Predict something. Surely you're not surprised I ask. You would have foreseen it--no?
TRELAWNEY	216	The--the Inner Eye does not See upon command!
UMBRIDGE	217	Come now, one teensy little prophecy...No? Pity.
TRELAWNEY	218	I...I think I do see something... something dark...
SNAPE	219	Yes.
UMBRIDGE	220	But you were unsuccessful...?
SNAPE	221	Obviously.
UMBRIDGE	222	Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you?
SNAPE	223	I suggest you ask him.
UMBRIDGE	224	Come in.
UMBRIDGE	225	Good evening, Mr. Potter. You know why you are here?
HARRY	226	Pink. Er...yes.
HARRY	227	And telling the truth.
UMBRIDGE	228	You are going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter.
UMBRIDGE	229	Now: I want you to write 'I must not tell lies.'
HARRY	230	How many times?
UMBRIDGE	231	Oh, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in.
HARRY	232	You haven't given me any ink.
UMBRIDGE	233	Oh, you won't need ink.
UMBRIDGE	234	Yes?
UMBRIDGE	235	That's right. Because deep down, you know you deserve to be punished. Don't you, Mr. Potter...
FRED	236	...oh, now he's feeling it!
GEORGE	237	Sweets to make you ill!
FRED	238	Get out of class whenever you like!
GEORGE	239	Extract hours of leisure from unprofitable boredom!
FRED	240	Care for another? As Nigel races off to vomit George and Fred high-five. FIND Ron and Hermione entering, mid-conversation.
RON	241	...I'm not asking you to write all of it for me, just...most of it.
HERMIONE	242	All right; I'll do the introduction--but that's all. 42.
HERMIONE	243	I'll know you're back to normal.
HERMIONE	244	What's wrong with your hand?
HERMIONE	245	You've got to tell Dumbledore.
RON	246	Bloody hell Harry, the woman's torturing you! If the parents knew about this--!
HARRY	247	Well I haven't got any of those, have I Ron!
HERMIONE	248	Harry...You've got to report this. It's a simple matter of--
HARRY	249	No it's not!
HARRY	250	Hermione...Whatever's going on here...it isn't simple. 43.
HARRY	251	You don't understand.
HERMIONE	252	Then help us to.
LUNA	253	Hello, Harry Potter.
LUNA	254	They're called Thestrals. They're quite gentle, really, but most
HARRY	255	Different.
LUNA	256	My Mum. She was quite an
HARRY	257	I'm sorry.
HARRY	258	Um...Thanks. Seems you're about
LUNA	259	Oh, I don't think that's true... Luna reaches into a bag and produces a piece of RAW MEAT; gently tosses it toward the BABY THESTRAL, who happily catches it in mid-air.
LUNA	260	...But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
HARRY	261	What do you mean?
LUNA	262	Well if I were You-Know-Who...I'd want you to be cut off from everyone else. Because if it's just you alone... you're not as much of a threat.
HERMIONE	263	Don't you ever stop eating?
RON	264	Wha'? Ah'm 'ungry...
RON	265	Harry.
HARRY	266	All right if I join you?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	267	...I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students, you conform to prescribed disciplinary practices...
UMBRIDGE	268	So silly of me, but it sounds as though you're questioning my authority in my own classroom...
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	269	Not at all...
UMBRIDGE	270	I am sorry dear...but to question my practices is to question the Ministry--and, by extension, the Minister himself. I am a tolerant woman, but the one thing I can't stand for is disloyalty.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	271	Disloyalty--?
UMBRIDGE	272	Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action...
FUDGE	273	--Having already revolutionised
LUCIUS MALFOY	274	As a parent, I believe the Ministry is doing what's best for all our sakes...
HARRY	275	Cho--what's going on?
CHO	276	It's Professor Trelawney. 50. 54 OMITTED 54 54A OMITTED 54A & & 54B 54B 55 OMITTED 55 55A OMITTED 55A & & 55B 55B 56 OMITTED 56 56A OMITTED 56A & & 56B 56B 57 OMITTED 57 57A OMITTED 57A
TRELAWNEY	277	S-Sixteen years I've lived and taught here! H- Hogwarts is m-my h-home! You c-can't do this!
UMBRIDGE	278	Actually...
UMBRIDGE	279	Something you'd like to say, dear?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL	280	Oh, there are several things I'd like to say.
UMBRIDGE	281	Dumbledore: May I remind you that under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, as enacted by the Minister--!
DUMBLEDORE	282	--you have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however,
DUMBLEDORE	283	I trust you all have studying to do?
HARRY	284	Professor? Professor--!
HERMIONE	285	That foul, evil old gargoyle! We've got to do something! 52.
HERMIONE	286	THAT'S NOT THE POINT, RON! We're not learning how to defend ourselves, we're not learning what we need to pass our OWLS, she's taking over the entire school-- what's Dumbledore playing at?
ANNOUNCER	287	At the witching hour, here are the latest headlines...Cornelius Fudge today denied rumors that the mysterious disappearance of several Ministry workers is related to last year's appearance of the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup...
ANNOUNCER	288	...With increased incidents of Goblin unrest as well as rumblings among the Giants, the Minister sought to quell the qualms of the wizard world:
HARRY	289	Sirius! What are you doing here? 53.
SIRIUS	290	Answering your letter. You said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing, training you all to kill half breeds?
HARRY	291	Half-breeds? What are you talking about?
HARRY	292	Sirius, she's not letting us use magic at all.
SIRIUS	293	I might have guessed. Latest intelligence is Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.
HARRY	294	What can we do, Sirius?
SIRIUS	295	I'm not sure...I do know your Dad never would have lain down for the likes of Umbridge.
HERMIONE	296	We've got to be able to defend ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how...
HARRY	297	This is mad. Who'd want to be taught by me? I'm a nutter, remember?
RON	298	Look on the bright side--you can't be any worse than old toad-face. 55.
RON	299	I'm here for you, mate.
RON	300	Lovely spot.
HERMIONE	301	I thought it'd be safer someplace off the beaten track.
HARRY	302	Who's supposed to be meeting us?
HERMIONE	303	Oh, just a couple of people...
HERMIONE	304	Um--hi. So, you all know why we're here. We need a teacher--a proper teacher, one who's had real experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts--
SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL BOY	305	Why? 56.
RON	306	Why? Because You-Know-Who is back, you tosspot!
HERMIONE	307	So Dumbledore says--
SLIGHTLY CREEPY BOY	308	If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed...
HARRY	309	I'm not going to talk about Cedric. So if that's what you're here for, you might as well clear out now.
HARRY	310	Let's go. They're just here because
HERMIONE	311	Yes. I've seen it. A fully-formed stag Patronus.
DEAN THOMAS	312	Blimey Harry! I never knew that!
GINNY	313	It's true.
HARRY	314	Wait.
HARRY	315	Look--it all sounds great when you say it like that. But the truth is,
HARRY	316	No, Hermione. I'm not.
HARRY	317	You just...you don't know what it's like.
HERMIONE	318	You're right Harry. We don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're to have any chance of beating V-Voldemort...
HARRY	319	We're the young ones now.
HARRY	320	Too small.
RON	321	Not bloody likely.
GINNY	322	Harry...What happens if Umbridge does find out?
RON	323	Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger? 59.
HARRY	324	What's that?
HARRY	325	Okay: in the next few days each of us comes up with a couple of possibilities for places to practice... As the others nod we MOVE IN ON Neville, his brow creased in concentration...
DRACO MALFOY	326	Watch where you're going, Longbottom...
HERMIONE	327	You've done it, Neville! You've found the Room of Requirement!
HERMIONE	328	I've heard rumors about it for ages but I never believed them until now...!
RON	329	So, say you really needed a toilet...?
HERMIONE	330	Charming, Ronald. But yes, that's
HARRY	331	It's brilliant. Like Hogwarts wants us to fight back... Suddenly a glint of silver falls past Harry's face. Harry
HARRY	332	All right...so...I was thinking
SLIGHTLY CREEPY BOY	333	Isn't that sort of...basic?
HARRY	334	It saved my life last year. An impressed MURMUR. Ron and Hermione exchange a happy look...Harry exhales--he's begun.
A DEATH EATER	335	towers above us, its hideous skull-like MASK grinning. PULL BACK to reveal it is a quite realistic-looking DUMMY, its arms extended, one hand holding a prodigious bone WAND. Uneasy STUDENTS stand in a line before it--Neville first.
NEVILLE	336	Expelliarmus!
NEVILLE	337	I'm hopeless.
HARRY	338	No you're not. You're just flourishing your wand too much. Here, try it like this--
UMBRIDGE	339	--to ensure maximum retention.
HERMIONE	340	No need to think's more like it.
UMBRIDGE	341	Wands away!
HARRY	342	....it's sort of a wizard's bread and butter, really... Students LAUGH appreciatively; as Harry turns we see who he's squared off against--a very nervous Nigel. Harry smiles encouragingly:
HARRY	343	It's all right, Nigel. Take your best shot.
NIGEL	344	STUPEFY!
HARRY	345	Not bad. Next--
RON	346	Don't worry--I'll go easy on you.
RON	347	I--I let her do that. I mean it's just good manners, isn't it!
THRU THRU	348	69C 69C
HARRY	349	Little higher there...nice.
HARRY	350	...every great wizard in history started out as nothing more than what we are now--students. If they could do it...why not you? Harry turns to survey the room--STUDENTS FLOATING in the
THRU THRU	351	73 73 73A OMITTED 73A
GINNY	352	REDUCTO! --as the DUMMY EXPLODES into dust!
NEVILLE	353	I--I did it.
FRED	354	We've been thinking, Harry--we could slip Umbridge some puking
GEORGE	355	Or Fever Fudge--they give you these massive pus-filled boils right on your--
HARRY	356	Sounds good guys...would you excuse me?
HARRY	357	Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day...
CHO	358	I'm okay. Anyway it's worth it...
CHO	359	It's just...learning all this...it makes me wonder whether if he'd known it...
CHO	360	You're a really good teacher, Harry. I've never been able to Stun anything before... Cho looks into Harry's eyes. The moment is palpable...and as Cho silently glances up, we SWEEP UP TO REVEAL the
CHO	361	Mistletoe.
CHO	362	What are Nargles?
HARRY	363	No idea.
RON	364	Well? How was it?
HARRY	365	Wet.
HERMIONE	366	I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half
RON	367	You'd think a bit of snogging
HERMIONE	368	Well obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric, and therefore confused about liking Harry and
RON	369	One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode!
HERMIONE	370	Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon...
DUMBLEDORE	371	...in the dream, were you standing beside the victim, or looking down
HARRY	372	Neither. It was like I...I...
HARRY	373	Professor...please...just tell me--
DUMBLEDORE	374	Everard.
DUMBLEDORE	375	Phineas: I need you to go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell
HARRY	376	What's happening to me...?
SNAPE	377	You wished to see me, Headmaster?
DUMBLEDORE	378	Yes, Severus. I'm afraid we daren't wait even until morning.
SNAPE	379	It would appear there is a connection between the Dark Lord's
HARRY	380	You mean if he knows...he'll be able to read my mind?
SNAPE	381	Read it. Control it. Unhinge it... In the past it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the

THRU THRU	383	88F 88F
KREACHER	384	Of course, Master. Kreacher lives to serve the Noble House of Black...
HARRY	385	Wait a second--you grew up here? 76.
SIRIUS	386	It was my parents house. I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order. About the only useful thing I've been able to do.
SIRIUS	387	I hated the lot of them; my parents
SIRIUS	388	My Mother did that after I ran away. Charming woman. I was sixteen.
HARRY	389	Where did you go?
SIRIUS	390	Your Dad's. I was always welcome at the Potter's... I see him so much in you, Harry. You're so very much alike...
HARRY	391	I'm not so sure.
HARRY	392	This connection between me and Voldemort--what if the reason for it is because...is because I'm
SIRIUS	393	I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You are not a bad person. You're a very good person, who bad things have happened to. Do you understand?
HERMIONE	394	Harry? Time to go.
HARRY	395	Seems like we're always saying goodbye.
SIRIUS	396	It won't always be this way. When all this is over we'll be a proper family. You'll see. As Sirius and Harry hug, we MOVE PAST them toward the tapestry. We PUSH IN on the SCORCHED HOLE above Sirius' name--FLY THROUGH IT-- 89A OMITTED 89A
THRU THRU	397	89D 89D
UMBRIDGE	398	...I will say this one last time. As High Inquisitor and the Ministry's representative I am ordering you to tell me where you've been!
HAGRID	399	I told yer--I've been away for me health.
UMBRIDGE	400	Your health.
HAGRID	401	Bit o' fresh air, yeh know.
UMBRIDGE	402	Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be difficult to come by.
HAGRID	403	I don't see what that has to do
UMBRIDGE	404	No...You wouldn't.
HERMIONE	405	Oh Hagrid, what happened?
HAGRID	406	I told yer, it's nothin'. Want a cuppa?
RON	407	Nothing? Would you say that if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?
HARRY	408	Hagrid...it's us.
HAGRID	409	Now this is all top secret, mind yeh...but Dumbledore sent me ter parley with the Giants.
HERMIONE	410	Giants!
HAGRID	411	They're not that difficult ter find, ter be honest. Pretty big, see. Live deep in the mountains... Went over a ridge one nigh' an'
HARRY	412	And they did this to you?
HAGRID	413	Anyhow I tried to convince 'em ter join the cause--but I wasn't the only one trying to win 'em over... 80.
RON	414	Death Eaters?
HAGRID	415	Don' know. I gave 'em Dumbledore's message; I 'spect some o' them'll remember he's friendly to 'em...I 'spect. Oh all right yeh can have it, yeh dozy dog... Fang, who has been WHIMPERING plaintively, now leaps up
HAGRID	416	It's changin' out there. Jus' like last time...
THRU THRU	417	95D 95D 96 OMITTED 96 96A OMITTED 96A
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE	418	My Lord.
FUDGE	419	We strongly suspect this breakout was engineered by a man with personal experience escaping Azkaban: notorious mass-murderer
SEAMUS	420	I wanted to apologize. Now even me Mam says the Prophet's version of things don't add up. What I'm trying to say is...I believe you.
NEVILLE	421	Fourteen years ago...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange used the Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She
HARRY	422	Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember. Allow it to fill you up...
HARRY	423	Keep trying, Seamus...
HARRY	424	Now remember: Your Patronus can only protect you as long as you stay focused...
HARRY	425	Focus, Luna.
HARRY	426	Think of the happiest thing you can, Neville.
NIGEL	427	Harry!
HARRY	428	Who've we got this time?
NIGEL	429	All of them I think. INSERT: On the MARAUDER'S MAP we see the names UMBRIDGE, FILCH, MALFOY--and a DOZEN OTHERS--floating just on the other side of the wall. Harry frowns.
UMBRIDGE	430	Stand aside, Argus. I'll make short work of this. She AIMS HER WAND directly at us. Harry's eyes go wide--
HARRY	431	GET DOWN!
UMBRIDGE	432	BOMBARDA MAXIMA!
HARRY	433	RUN!
UMBRIDGE	434	All your fearmongering about You- Know-Who never fooled us for a minute. We saw your lies for what they were--a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry!
DUMBLEDORE	435	Naturally.
HARRY	436	Professor--no--!
FUDGE	437	Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet; if we hurry we should still make the morning edition. Dawlish, Shacklebolt: You will escort Dumbledore to Azkaban to await trial for conspiracy and sedition--
DUMBLEDORE	438	Ah, I thought we might hit that little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to--what is the phrase? 'Come quietly.' But I'm afraid I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
SHACKLEBOLT	439	You may not like him, Minister... but you can't deny Dumbledore's got style.
DOOR SLAMS SHUT.	440	We CORKSCREW down and through the Marble Stair. Most of
CHO	441	Harry...
RON	442	...you did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
HERMIONE	443	He's right. Not even Dumbledore saw this coming. Besides, if it's anyone's fault it's ours...
RON	444	Yeah, we talked you into it. 88.
HARRY	445	But I agreed.
HARRY	446	...because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much. And the more you care...the more you have to lose.
HERMIONE	447	What?
HARRY	448	Go it alone.
HARRY	449	Hagrid...? 105A OMITTED 105A & & 105B 105B
RON	450	Any idea where he's taking us?
HARRY	451	Hagrid? Please, can't you just tell us--
HERMIONE	452	What is that?
RON	453	Whatever it is...it's not a happy sound.
HAGRID	454	Never seen the Centaurs so riled-- an' they're dangerous at the bes'
HAGRID	455	Sorry t'be so mysterious you three. I wouldn' be botherin' yer with this at all--but with Dumbledore gone I'll likely be gettin' the sack any day now, an' I can' leave
HARRY	456	About...who?
RON	457	Harry...that hill. It's breathing. As the "hill" shifts in its sleep several BIRDS light into the air. Hagrid cautiously approaches the slumbering
HERMIONE	458	Oh Hagrid...you didn't.
HAGRID	459	I had ter bring 'im back! The other giants were all bullyin' him, 'cause he's so small!
HERMIONE	460	Small?
HAGRID	461	I couldn' jus' leave 'im! See-- he's my brother.
RON	462	Blimey.
HAGRID	463	Well--half-brother. Turns out
HAGRID	464	Had a nice sleep, did yeh Grawpy?
HAGRID	465	Grawp! Down here, yeh big buffoon!
HAGRID	466	Come on now Grawpy! I brought yeh some company! 91.
HARRY	467	Hagrid...is this how you got all your injuries?
HAGRID	468	Oh, no no no no...well, yes. But he's a good boy, really--jes don'
HAGRID	469	GRAWPY! THA'S NOT POLITE!
RON	470	HAGRID, DO SOMETHING!
HAGRID	471	Don' you worry now, he's completely
HERMIONE	472	Grawp. GRAWP. Listen. Carefully: Put. Me. DOWN.
RON	473	Are you all right?
HERMIONE	474	Just needs a firm hand is all.
HARRY	475	I think you've got an admirer...
RON	476	You just stay away from her. Chastened, Grawp turns to where he's stored a collection
SNAPE	477	Feeling sentimental...? Suddenly the IMAGE SWIMS, RUSHES TOWARD US--WHOOSH-- 108 OMITTED 108 93.
HARRY	478	That's--private.
SNAPE	479	Not to me--and not to the Dark Lord if you don't improve! Every
HARRY	480	Don't you say a word against my--
SNAPE	481	Weak.
HARRY	482	I'm. Not. Weak.
SNAPE	483	Then prove it. Control your emotions, discipline your mind! Legilimens--!
SIRIUS	484	...but know this: the ones who love us never really leave us. You
SNAPE	485	I may vomit.
HARRY	486	STOP IT--!
SNAPE	487	Is this what you call control?
HARRY	488	We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest--
HARRY	489	My father was a great man!
SNAPE	490	YOUR FATHER WAS A SWINE--
SNAPE	491	LEGILIMENS!
HARRY	492	PROTEGO!
YOUNG JAMES	493	HEY SNIVELLUS!
YOUNG JAMES	494	Expelliarmus!
YOUNG JAMES	495	Impedimenta!
HARRY	496	Dad...? Suddenly the memory SWIMS, JUMP CUTS--Harry remains
YOUNG JAMES	497	Well well, the indomitable Miss Evans...
HARRY	498	Mum...
YOUNG LILY	499	Why do you hate him so much, Potter?
YOUNG LILY	500	That's the thing, isn't it. Hate is always easy. It's the other bit that's hard. But you wouldn't understand that--would you.
YOUNG JAMES	501	Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants?
SNAPE	502	ENOUGH--!!!
SNAPE	503	Your lessons are at an end.
HARRY	504	I--

GEORGE	511	Don't bother to keep in touch, you old bat!
HARRY	512	Terror growing as we continue to PUSH IN. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Neville and others still cheering in SLOW MOTION as bits of burning proclamation fall like confetti, all in eerie SILENCE--ZZZP--
FLASH CUT	513	Sirius's FACE, contorted in agony--
HARRY	514	Shaking, white as a sheet now as Hermione finally notices,
SIRIUS	515	You'll have to kill me.
VOLDEMORT	516	Oh I will. But first you will fetch it for me. CRUCIO!
HERMIONE	517	Harry, are you sure?
HARRY	518	I saw it--just like with Mr. Weasley! It's the same door I've been dreaming about for months-- only I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before!
HERMIONE	519	Harry, please, just listen. What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? What if he's only hurting
RON	520	What do we do.
HARRY	521	Alert the Order if you can--
RON	522	Are you mental? We're going with you!
HARRY	523	It's too dangerous--!
HERMIONE	524	When are you going to get it through your head, Harry--we're in this together!
DRACO MALFOY	525	Caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl.
UMBRIDGE	526	You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you.
HARRY	527	No-- 103.
UMBRIDGE	528	Snape. Yes. The time has come for
SNAPE	529	I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students; the last of it on Miss Chang...
HARRY	530	He's got Padfoot! He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden!
UMBRIDGE	531	Padfoot? What is "Padfoot?" Where
SNAPE	532	No idea.
UMBRIDGE	533	Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is an issue of Ministry security, you leave me
UMBRIDGE	534	What Cornelius doesn't know won't
HARRY	535	You sent the Dementors?!
UMBRIDGE	536	Somebody had to act! All that useless deliberating about what should be done, or whether this or
UMBRIDGE	537	Tell me...what?
HERMIONE	538	Well if you won't tell her where it is, I will! It's not worth another student dying!
UMBRIDGE	539	Where what is?
HERMIONE	540	Dumbledore's secret weapon. 127 OMITTED 127
UMBRIDGE	541	How much further?
HERMIONE	542	Not far. It had to be somewhere students weren't going to find it accidentally. 105. OWLS HOOT; RUSTLINGS from the shadows. Umbridge FLINCHES at every sound, growing more paranoid by the minute.
HARRY	543	What are you doing?
HERMIONE	544	Improvising.
UMBRIDGE	545	Well? Where is this weapon?
UMBRIDGE	546	You know...I really hate children. You really are the most...
UMBRIDGE	547	I MEAN LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME! I really cannot take it anymore...
UMBRIDGE	548	Y-You have no business here, Centaur! This is a Ministry matter...

UMBRIDGE	558	UNHAND ME YOU BEASTS--you ANIMALS!! I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge! Let me GOOOooo---!! 108.
MAGORIAN	559	They are young. We do not attack foals.
BANE	560	Not so young--
MAGORIAN	561	True...But there remains the scent
MAGORIAN	562	Go, humans.
HERMIONE	563	Thank you, Grawp.
HARRY	564	Sirius.
HERMIONE	565	How did you get away?
RON	566	Told 'em I was hungry and wanted
GINNY	567	Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
NEVILLE	568	It was brilliant! But how are we going to get to London...?
HARRY	569	Look...it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you...but I've got you into enough trouble as it is, and...
RON	570	Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.
HARRY	571	So how are we going to get to London? 110.
HARRY	572	It's this way.

LUCIUS MALFOY	582	...now give me the Prophecy.
HARRY	583	Sirius--
LUCIUS MALFOY	584	It's time you learned the difference between reality and dreams, Potter--you saw what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now give. That. To me.
HARRY	585	Get behind me.
LUCIUS MALFOY	586	Bellatrix, no.
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE	587	Master Longbottom! How's Mum and Dad?

NEVILLE	589	EXPELLIARMUS! Just as a JET OF FIERY LIGHT shoots from Bellatrix' wand
LUCIUS MALFOY	590	DO NOT ATTACK. WE NEED THAT
HARRY	591	I don't understand. Why did
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE	592	Filthy half-blood. You dare speak
LUCIUS MALFOY	593	As those who died trying to acquire it for the Dark Lord learned-- prophecies can only be retrieved

GINNY	603	breathing hard, visible watching THROUGH the prophecies
GINNY	604	REDUCTO!
GINNY	605	Y-you were right, Harry. This isn't at all like being in school. Suddenly a DEEP RUMBLING is heard. As Harry and Ginny

HERMIONE	608	There aren't any voices, Harry. Let's get out of here--

LUCIUS MALFOY	612	Did you actually believe...Were you really naive enough to think that children stood a chance against...us?
LUCIUS MALFOY	613	I'll make it easy for you, Potter.
SIRIUS	614	Get away from my Godson.
LUCIUS MALFOY	615	No... Now the SOUND of RUSHING WIND spins the heads of the stunned Death Eaters as a WHITE VAPOR TRAIL circles in from above-- --as the kids use the diversion to elbow, kick and pull
MADEYE MOODY	616	Oh no you don't, Boyo--
SIRIUS	617	Harry--are you all right?
HARRY	618	Sirius...I thought...I mean I saw...
HARRY	619	What? No! I'm staying with you!
SIRIUS	620	Harry--
HARRY	621	Sirius, I won't lose you again!
SIRIUS	622	Harry...my life...has largely been
SIRIUS	623	dueling Malfoy before the VEIL. BOLTS of FIRE explode
LUCIUS MALFOY	624	You should have stayed in hiding, Black!
SIRIUS	625	When I'm done with you, Malfoy--
SIRIUS	626	Come now Cousin, we can do better than that!
HARRY	627	Can't take it anymore. Hermione sees it. With quiet urgency:
HERMIONE	628	Go.
MALFOY AND DOLOHOV	629	advance on the pinned Sirius, wands extended--Sirius is helpless as Malfoy moves in for the kill--
SIRIUS	630	Good one, James!
HARRY	631	Sirius, look out--!
SIRIUS	632	It's all right Harry! I'm back--
HARRY	633	Sirius?
LUPIN	634	No, Harry--he's gone.
HARRY	635	SIRIUS!
LUPIN	636	Harry, no--!
HARRY	637	CRUCIO!!
BELLATRIX LESTRANGE	638	M-master--I tried, but, the
VOLDEMORT	639	Don't speak to me. Or can you restore my broken Prophecy?
VOLDEMORT	640	You know the spell. Do it--
VOLDEMORT	641	You're too late, old man. The boy knows the truth.
VOLDEMORT	642	That you've been lied too... betrayed...just as I once was.
VOLDEMORT	643	NO. Because he "loved" you.
VOLDEMORT	644	Why did your mother and father die? Why will your friends die, when
DUMBLEDORE	645	Harry--
DUMBLEDORE	646	It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on
VOLDEMORT	647	Yes. By which time I shall be gone, and you dead--
HARRY	648	dimly becomes aware of what's going on. SOUND is distant,
VOLDEMORT	649	suddenly inhales deeply--focuses intently--
DUMBLEDORE	650	Harry! Stay where you are--! --Voldemort vanishes--
VOLDEMORT	651	LOOK AT ME! ZZZP. For a split second we are back in the Atrium--Harry
HARRY	652	NO...
DUMBLEDORE	653	Don't fight him Harry! You can't
SIRIUS	654	What matters is the part we choose to act on...
SIRIUS	655	That's who we really are.
HARRY	656	Because he murdered you!
DUMBLEDORE	657	Harry...it's not how you are alike--it's how you're not. Confusion...then the glimmer of understanding begins to
HARRY	658	You'll never know friendship--or love, or real happiness--and I-- FEEL--SORRY--FOR--YOU--! 133. ZZZP--for a second Harry again stands before Voldemort's reflection-- --as with a final surge of defiance Harry SMASHES the Mirror-- IN THE ATRIUM--Harry is suddenly buffeted by a violent WIND--
VOLDEMORT	659	You are a fool, Harry Potter...
VOLDEMORT	660	And you will lose everything.
FUDGE	661	He's back.
THRU THRU	662	147 147
DUMBLEDORE	663	Please. Come in?
DUMBLEDORE	664	Harry...I know how you must be feeling... 135.
DUMBLEDORE	665	No, Harry....the fault is mine.
DUMBLEDORE	666	Harry...as much as it pains me to disillusion you, I am all too fallible...and this war that has now begun may just as easily be lost as won. THUNDER RUMBLES. For the first time Harry really looks
DUMBLEDORE	667	I knew it was only a matter of time before Voldemort became aware of the connection between you, and tried to exploit it. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I
DUMBLEDORE	668	Yes.
HARRY	669	Why didn't you tell me?
RON	670	Feast's about to start.
HARRY	671	Thanks Ron...but I'm not really in
RON	672	You know...I'm not really that hungry. I could...
HARRY	673	How come you're not at the feast?
LUNA	674	I'm trying to find my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding
HARRY	675	That's awful.
LUNA	676	Oh, it's all good fun...but as it's last night I really do need
LUNA	677	I'm sorry about your Godfather, Harry.
HARRY	678	You sure you don't want help looking? 138.
LUNA	679	That's all right. Anyway, my Mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in
LUNA	680	...if not always in the way we expect.
HARRY	681	I've been thinking about something
HERMIONE	682	What's that, Harry?
HARRY	683	Even though we've got a fight ahead of us...we've also got one thing Voldemort doesn't have.
RON	684	What's that?
