RON	190	Mind? Everywhere else is full.
RON	192	I’m Ron, by the way.
RON	194	I...heard. 31.
RON	195	Wicked.
RON	197	Huh? Oh. I think so. Well, Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant. But we never talk about him. I heard you went to live with
RON	198	Five. I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others. But if I do, it's no big deal because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes. Charlie's old wand. Even Scabbers used to be Percy's...
RON	199	Hardly ever wakes up. He's useless basically. Percy got an owl for making Prefect, but Mum and Dad couldn't afford-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead. Roh looks embarrassed. Just then, a DIMPLED WOMAN pushing a
RON	203	That's rotten luck. They've only
RON	205	I've about six of him. Trade you Scabbers though, if you get Agrippa or Ptolemy. 33.
RON	206	Thought he'd be older, did you?
RON	208	Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?
RON	210	Pathetic, isn't it? Fred gave me a
HERMIONE	211	Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named
RON	212	Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. Scabbers SNORTS, but otherwise remains fat, grey, and asleep.
HERMIONE	213	Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example...
HERMIONE	214	Goodness. You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I know all about you, of course. I was doing a little recreational reading and you're in Modern Magical History, The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the 20th Century.
HERMIONE	216	Didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me.
HERMIONE	217	There. That's better, isn't it? I'm Hermione Granger, by the way. And you are...?
RON	218	Um...Ron Weasley.
HERMIONE	219	35. Pleasure. Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I'm hoping for Gryffindor--I hear Dumbledore himself was in it--but I think I
RON	226	Some kind of test, I think. Fred says it hurts like hell, but I'm sure he was joking. At least...I
HERMIONE	231	Well, he's rather disagreeable,
HERMIONE	233	38. It's not real, the ceiling. It's only bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.
HERMIONE	235	I hear he's a genius. As the applause subsides, the hat TWITCHES. At the brim, a rip OPENS WIDE, and the hat begins to TALK.
HERMIONE	238	Oh dear. Here it is, isn't it? The moment. Goodness. What if the hat says nothing and we're all just left standing here forever... 39.
RON	241	Slytherin. Draco Malfoy swaggers forth and grips the hat. He's barely
RON	245	Harry? What is it?
RON	260	42. I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick.
RON	273	This is Staircase Twelve North, which should take us to Backward Staircase Seven—no wait a minute, we're on Backward Staircase Seven... 45.
HERMIONE	275	One hundred forty-two, though, in A History of Magic, Bathilda Bagshot makes unattributed reference to three others.
RON	276	I hate her.
RON	277	Whew! We made it, mate. Can you imagine old McGonagall's face if we were late first day out... Hearing this, the cat narrows its eyes, leaps up and...TRANSFORMS...into old McGonagall herself. Ron's mouth drops open in amazement.
RON	278	That was bloody brilliant!
SNAPE	283	There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...
SNAPE	284	Mr. Potter. Our hew...celebrity. Tell me. What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
SNAPE	285	You don't know. Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar? 47.
SNAPE	287	And the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
SNAPE	289	Pity. Clearly fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter.
SNAPE	291	Silence! And put your hand down, you silly girl!
SNAPE	292	For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is know as the Draught of the Living Dead. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As
SNAPE	293	And Gryffindors. Note that five points will be taken from your House for your classmate's cheek.
RON	296	Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday before it... PFFFT! BLUE FLAMES shoot over the rim of the glass.
RON	297	Hey look! Neville's gotten a Remembrall!
HERMIONE	298	I've read about those. If the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten something.
RON	301	It’s mad. Dad says there are dragons guarding some of the vaults.
HERMIONE	318	Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know how to...fly.
RON	326	Seeker! But first years never make the House teams. You must be the youngest Quidditch player in--
RON	331	Oh go on, Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game there is. And you'll be great too.
HERMIONE	333	You won't make a fool of yourself.
HERMIONE	334	It's in your blood.
RON	335	Harry...you didn't tell me your
RON	337	I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
RON	339	Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?
HERMIONE	340	We're not supposed to be here. This is the Third Floor. It's forbidden.
HERMIONE	341	Because Dumbledore said so. Let's go.
RON	342	That's it. We're done for.
HERMIONE	343	55. Oh, move over. Alohomora!
HERMIONE	344	Standard Book of Spells. Chapter Seven.
RON	345	Chapter Seven?
HERMIONE	346	Shhh! Filch is...gone.
HERMIONE	347	It was locked.
HERMIONE	349	56. You don't use yqur eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?
RON	350	I wasn't looking at its feet. I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three.
HERMIONE	351	It was standing on a trapdoor, which means-it's not there by accident. It's...
HERMIONE	353	That's right. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'll go to bed before either of you figures out another clever way to get us killed. Or worse...expelled.
RON	367	WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!
HERMIONE	368	Honestly. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-ohhhh- sa. Not Levi-o-saaaah.
RON	369	You do it then, if you're so clever.
HERMIONE	370	Wingardium Leviosa. Hermione swishes and flicks. Instantly the feather rises.
RON	373	It'sLevi-ohhhhh-sa. Not Levi-o- saaaah. She's a nightmare,
RON	385	Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably Peeves' playing jokes...
RON	387	Smells like Fred's socks. Only...worse.
RON	389	Yes!
RON	391	Don't worry, Hermione! We're here!
HERMIONE	392	I heard that! 62.
RON	393	What do we do?
RON	394	Confuse it?
RON	395	Wingardium Leviosa.
RON	396	Wingardium LEVI-OHHHH-SA! With that, the club quivers upon the floor...begins to rise.
HERMIONE	397	Is it--dead?
RON	399	No need to kill it, after all.
HERMIONE	402	It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.
HERMIONE	404	I went looking for the troll. I've read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If
RON	407	Mind you, we did save her from a full grown mountain troll.
RON	409	What are friends for?
RON	410	Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.
HERMIONE	411	Ron's right, Harry. You're going to need your strength today.
HERMIONE	413	That was...disturbing.
RON	414	I tell you what's disturbing. Snape smiling.
HERMIONE	416	Blood?
HERMIONE	418	But why would anyone go near that dog?
HERMIONE	420	So you're saying...
RON	422	"But what's safer than Gringotts?
HERMIONE	424	Well, whatever it is, it must be really valuable.
HERMIONE	426	Bit early for mail, isn't it?
RON	429	That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand.
RON	443	Maybe something happened to it when
RON	445	Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
HERMIONE	446	Leave it to me. As Hermione dashes off, Ron turns the binoculars back to the sky. Harry hangs from the broom with two hands while Fred hovers nearby. George circles about ten feet below.
RON	452	Come on, Hermione... Just then, BLUE FLAMES spit from Hermione's wand, climbing quickly up Snape's robes. Snape continues to mutter, staring skyward, then realizes he's on fire, and looks away. In the commotion, that ensues, Ron sees Hermione scoop the blue fire
RON	458	Fluffy?
HERMIONE	459	That thing has a name?
HERMIONE	465	Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid. I've
RON	470	Queen to pawn six.
HERMIONE	471	Oh my god! That's barbaric!
RON	472	That's chess. I see you're packed.
HERMIONE	473	I see you're not.
RON	474	Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.
HERMIONE	475	You can help Harry then. He promised to keep looking in the library for Nicolas Flamel over holiday.
RON	476	We have looked. A hundred times. 74.
RON	477	I think we've had a bad influence
RON	478	Happy Christmas, Harry!
RON	480	What'd you expect? In your hand's from Hagrid. And by the looks of that lumpy one, Mum's sent you a Weasley sweater.
RON	483	Well, let's see then. Put it on. As Harry takes the cloth, we hang on Ron, watching, then:
RON	484	Ahhh! Harry's head is floating in midair. Ron looks on in awe.
RON	485	75. Harry, do you know what this is? It’s an invisibility cloak. They're really rare. Who gave you this?
SNAPE	488	Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s, yet?
SNAPE	490	You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrel.
SNAPE	492	You know perfectly well what I mean. Your little bit of hocus pocus...
SNAPE	493	We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decide where your loyalties lie.
RON	502	Me. Only I'm...Head Boy! And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup and...bloody hell...I'm Quidditch Captain too! Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
RON	503	Want to play chess?
RON	505	Want to go visit Hagrid?
RON	507	Harry, I know what you're thinking. But don't. There's something not right about that mirror.
HERMIONE	516	I'll ask you again. What are the three most Crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
RON	517	And I'll tell you again. I forgot.
HERMIONE	518	And what, may I ask, do you plan to do should you get that question on final exams?
RON	519	Crib off you.
HERMIONE	520	You will not. Besides, according to
RON	521	You’ve got to start standing up to
RON	526	All right then, Neville, who shall it be? Me, Hermione, or...
RON	527	He's bowling. So what? He's always bowling.
RON	528	'Dumbledore is particularly famous
HERMIONE	530	Follow me.
HERMIONE	532	How could I be so stupid! I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
RON	533	This is light?
HERMIONE	534	Of course! Here it is!
HERMIONE	535	Oh, honestly, don't you two read?
RON	536	Immortal.
HERMIONE	537	It means you'll never die. 83.
RON	538	I know what it means—
HERMIONE	539	’The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who
HERMIONE	541	Teaches at Hogwarts.
RON	542	So Snape wants piles of gold and to live forever. Who wouldn't?
HERMIONE	544	I don't want to scare you, Harry. It's just...if all Snape wants is
HERMIONE	553	Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments...
RON	557	I know what that is! But Hagrid. How did you ever get one?
HERMIONE	559	Is that...a dragon?
RON	560	That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
RON	565	But it's crazy. And worse, Malfoy, knows.
RON	567	It's bad.
RON	569	Norwegian Ridgeback.
RON	570	I just meant... in this case...sorry.
RON	578	Why bother? Even with Malfoy losing points, Slytherin's a lock for the House Cup. And look. Malfoy knows it.
HERMIONE	581	Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll
RON	583	A baby that breaths fire.
HERMIONE	605	Harry!
RON	607	You mean...You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest!
RON	609	But if he comes back, you don't think he'd try to...kill you? Do you?
RON	611	And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
HERMIONE	612	No. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
HERMIONE	613	I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of year exams were frightful. But I found that rather enjoyable. Weren’t you stunned not to be asked about Elfric the Eager?
RON	614	I'm stunned my head didn't explode. Alright there, Harry? 94.
HERMIONE	616	It's happened before...
HERMIONE	619	Harry?
HERMIONE	634	And with Dumbledore gone...
SNAPE	635	Now what would three fine Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on such a lovely day?
HERMIONE	636	We were just...
SNAPE	637	You want to be careful. People will think you're...up to something. Snape eyes Harry, then turns away.
HERMIONE	638	What do we do now?
RON	640	Trevor! Shh! Go! You shouldn't be here.
RON	645	To people. Not us.
HERMIONE	646	Neville. I'm really, really sorry about this.
RON	647	You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant. But scary.
HERMIONE	650	That was close.
RON	651	Sorry. I get hungry when I'm nervous.
RON	652	Wait a minute. He's...
RON	655	Don't be stupid.
HERMIONE	656	We're coming.
HERMIONE	659	The harp...what happened to the— Splat! Something wet and sticky hits Ron's shoulder.
RON	660	Yuck! What's this ruddy stuff—
RON	661	That was...cool.
RON	663	Lucky this plant thing's here, really.
RON	665	Wo! Twin creepers encircle Harry's chest.
HERMIONE	666	Stop moving! Both of you! This is Devil's Snare! You have to relax.
HERMIONE	668	I know, Harry. But you must. If you don't, it'll only kill you faster.
RON	669	Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax.
RON	670	What are we going to do now!
HERMIONE	673	Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. Dances in the dark, delights in the damp...
HERMIONE	674	It's deadly fun, but will...sulk in the sunl That's it! Light! Devil's Snare hates the light!
RON	675	Lucky we didn't panic.
HERMIONE	677	What is that?
HERMIONE	679	Curious. I've never seen birds like these...
HERMIONE	682	103. Locked.
RON	683	Alohomora!
RON	684	Well, it was worth a try.
HERMIONE	685	What's wrong with its wing?
HERMIONE	687	Harry?
RON	689	Oh, go on, Harry. If Snape could catch it on that old CleanSweep, you can. It's not for nothing you're the youngest Seeker in a Century.
RON	690	Well, this complicates things a bit. As Harry kicks into the air, a seething cluster of keys falls
RON	691	He'll be torn to pieces.. Horrified, Ron and Hermione watch Harry soar higher, fending
HERMIONE	692	I don't like this. I don't like this at all. A small bouquet of BLUE FLAMES blooms in Hermione's hands, illuminating little more than the trio's faces and some VAGUE SHAPES looming ahead.
RON	694	This is no graveyard... Ron takes an unlit torch from the wall, touches it to the
RON	695	It's a chessboard. Sure enough. As the chamber glows with light, a kind of battlefield is revealed, studded with faceless soldiers.
HERMIONE	696	But what're we to do? As Hermione takes a tentative step onto the board, a BISHOP'S
RON	697	It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play pur way across the room. Excuse me...are we meant to join you?
RON	699	All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione— you'll be the Queenside castle. As for me... Ron leaps astride the only riderless horse.
RON	700	...I'll be a Knight.
HERMIONE	701	What happens now?
RON	702	We play. 106. Across the board, a WHITE PAWN moves forward two squares
HERMIONE	703	Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do you? Ron—contemplating something--doesn't answer immediately,
RON	704	You there...d5 As Ron's BLACK PAWN obliges, WHITE'S PAWN slides swiftly forth (to d5) and, with a THUNDEROUS collision, the black pawn EXPLODES, rubble raining to the ground.
RON	705	Yes, Hermione? I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess. DISSOLVE TO: ...the chess board, a real battlefield now, littered on both sides with fallen pieces. Ron, drained but intense, surveys the board, MUTTERING to himself.
RON	706	Think...Think.
RON	708	107. There's just one problem with that. It's you that has to go on, Harry. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You.
HERMIONE	710	What is it?
HERMIONE	712	No. There has to be another way!
RON	713	Do you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone or not!
HERMIONE	716	You're a great wizard, Harry Potter! You are, you know!
HERMIONE	717	Me! Books. And cleverness. There are more important things— friendship and bravery and—-oh, Harry, be careful!
VOLDEMORT	729	Yes. You see what I've become. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough...lies in your pocket.
VOLDEMORT	730	Don't be a fool, Harry. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join me...and live.
VOLDEMORT	732	Ah, bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry...would you like to see your mother and father again?
VOLDEMORT	733	Together, we can bring them back. All I ask...is for something in return. Slowly, almost involuntarily, Harry removes the Stone from
VOLDEMORT	734	That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just...give me the Stone.
VOLDEMORT	737	Fool! Get the Stone!
RON	759	All right. You?
HERMIONE	761	Never better.
RON	762	D'you think Dumbledore meant for it all to happen? And for you to do it? Sending you your father's cloak and all?
HERMIONE	763	Well, if he did—I mean—that's terrible. You could have been killed. Come to think of it, I could've been killed...
RON	769	Of course! And now that he's
RON	771	You'd think saving the bloody
HERMIONE	778	Oh my goodness. We've tied Slytherin!
RON	781	Come on now, Harry.
HERMIONE	787	Feels strange, doesn' t it? To be going home.
