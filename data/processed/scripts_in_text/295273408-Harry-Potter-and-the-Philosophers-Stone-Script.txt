Harry and Ron are eating the food. Ron tries to do magic.
RON
Woah!
HARRY
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
RON
They mean every flavor! There's
chocolate and peppermint and also,
spinach, liver and tripe. George
sweared he got boogie flavored one
once.
HARRY
These aren't real frogs, are they?
RON
It's just a spell. Besides, it's
the cards you want. Each pack's got
a famous witch or wizard. I got
about 500 meself. Watch it! That's
rotten luck. They've only got one
good jump in them to begin with.
HARRY
I've got Dumbledore!
RON
I've got about 6 of him.
HARRY
Hey, he's gone!
RON
Well you can't expect him to hang
around all day, can you? This is
Scabbers by the way. Pathetic,
isn't he?
HARRY
Just a little bit.

RON
Fred gave me a spell to turn him
yellow. Want to see?
HARRY
Yeah!
RON
Ahem. Sun...
Hermione meets Ron and Harry. They talk and do some magic.
Then Hermione goes out.
HERMIONE
Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named
Neville's lost one.
RON
No.
HERMIONE
Oh, you are doing magic? Let's see
then.
RON
Ahem. Sunshine Daisies Butter
Mellow Turn this stupid fat rat
yellow.
HERMIONE
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it? Of
course, I've only tried a few
simple ones myself but they've all
worked for me. For example: Oculus
Reparo. That's better, isn't it?
Holy cricket! You're Harry Potter!
I'm Hermione Granger. And you are?
RON
I'm Ron Weasley.
HERMIONE
Pleasure. You two better change
into you robes. I expect we'll be
arriving soon. You've got dirt on
your nose by the way. Did you know?
Just there.
