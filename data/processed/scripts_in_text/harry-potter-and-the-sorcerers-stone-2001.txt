into a little jar, slip it. into robe, and.make her escape.

crazed, eyes riveted to the fluttering Snitch, seeing it and
only it. Higgs, on the other hand, sees only the ground and,
at the last minute, can bear it no longer, PULLINGU P on his

Nimbus cartwheels away, Harry rolls off and, corning up on all

Good afternoon, Barry.

What happened down in the dungeons
between you and Professor Quirrell is

DUMBLEDORE .
Fine. Bothof them~ Madame Pomfrey has
explicitly forbidden visitors. But I·
think--wi th·. the help of a certain cloak-- ·
they've managed.to monitor your progress.

".:Relax, ;dear boy. The Stone has been *
destroyed. My friend Nicolas and I had a
little chat and agreed it was best all
around.
HARRY
But then, Flamel. •• he' 11 die, won't he? *
DUMBLEDORE
He has enough Elixir·to set his affairs *
in order. But, yes, he will die.
To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems *
incredible. But to the well-organized
mind, death is but the next great
adve.nture.
HARRY
But to destroy such·a remarkable thing •••
DUMBLEDORE.
Yes, yes. As much money and life as one
could ever want--the two things most
human beings would choose above all-else.
Unfortunately, humans do have a knack for
choosing precisely those things that are
worst for them.
HARRY
How is it I got the Stone, sir? One *
minute I was staring in the mirror-- *
DUMBLEDORE
Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to
find the Stone--find it, but not use it-
would be able to get it. One of my more *
brilliant ideas and, between you and me, *
that's saying something. *

I'm afraid there·are other ways.for him

Harry nods. Dumbledore studies .him thoughtfully. *
DUMBLEDOR(CEO NT'D). *
Do you know why Professor Quirrell
couldn't bear to touch you, Harry? It's *
because of your mother. She sacrificed *
herself for you. And that kind of act
leaves a mark.·
Harry reaches up to his scar.
DUMBLEOOR(CEO NT'D)
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It
lives in your very skin. It is the very
thing someone like Professo-r Quirrell-
full. of hatred and greed--cannot
understand. Or bear to touch.

Assuming my calculations are correct, I
believe a change of decoration is in

Dumbledore CLAPS his hands and--instantly--the green and
silver of Slytherin-becdme the scarlet and gold of
Gryffindor. Neville, white with shock, disappears under a.
pile of people hugging him. Draco Malfoy, looks stunned and ·
horrified. Snape, with a horrible, forced smile, shakes
Professor McGonagall's hand, then catches Harry's eye, his
hatred still evident, but not enough to mar the moment. Harry *
